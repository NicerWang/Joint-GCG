It appeared on his 1975 album Struttin' My Stuff and was released as a single the following year.  Bishop does not sing lead vocals on the track; feeling that his gravelly voice wouldn't do the song justice, he invited vocalist Mickey Thomas, who was a background singer in his band at the time, to sing it. The song peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in May 1976.[1]  The record was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on June 23, 1976.[2]  In Canada, the song reached number 22 on the singles chart[3] and number 8 on the Adult Contemporary chart.[4]  The song became a Gold record.", "\"Lovin' You\" is a 1975 hit single originally performed by American singer Minnie Riperton from her album Perfect Angel (1974).

The mono 45 USA released version contains the line \"We'll be falling in love\". However, on the stereo album version, the line \"We'll be making love\" is sung. These are two entirely different recordings, not edits of one another, as the line \"on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be\" is sung differently in each version. The version appearing on the Drifters' Golden Hits compilation is a composite of the two, using \"making love\" in the first two choruses and \"falling in love\" in the third.

It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford Site and dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar. For the Fat Man mission, Bockscar was piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney.", "On 6 August 1945, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew over the Japanese city of Hiroshima in southwest Honsh\u016b and dropped a gun-type uranium-235 atomic bomb (code-named Little Boy by the U.S.) on it. Two other B-29 aircraft were airborne nearby for the purposes of instrumentation and photography. When the planes first approached Hiroshima, Japanese anti-aircraft units in the city initially thought they were reconnaissance aircraft, since they were ordered not to shoot at one or few aircraft that did not pose a threat, in order to conserve their ammunition for large-scale air raids.  The bomb killed roughly 90,000\u2013166,000 people; half of these died quickly while the other half suffered lingering deaths.[226] The death toll included an estimated 20,000 Korean slave laborers and 20,000 Japanese soldiers) and destroyed 48,000 buildings (including the headquarters of the Second General Army and Fifth Division).[227]  On 9 August, three days later, the B-29 Bockscar flew over the Japanese city of Nagasaki in northwest Kyushu and dropped an implosion-type, plutonium-239 atomic bomb (code-named Fat Man by the U.S.) on it, again accompanied by two other B-29 aircraft for instrumentation and photography.  This bomb's effects killed roughly 39,000\u201380,000 people,[226] including roughly 23,000\u201328,000 Japanese war industry employees, an estimated 2,000 Korean forced workers, and at least 150 Japanese soldiers. The bomb destroyed 60% of the city.[227][228] The industrial damage in Nagasaki was high, partly owing to the inadvertent targeting of the industrial zone, leaving 68\u201380% of the non-dock industrial production destroyed.[229]", "In July 1945, the first atomic explosive device, dubbed \"Trinity\", was detonated in the New Mexico desert.

On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union renounced its non-aggression pact with Japan and attacked the Japanese in Manchuria, fulfilling its Yalta Conference pledge to attack the Japanese within three months after the end of the war in Europe. The attack was made by three Soviet army groups. On that same day, a second equally destructive atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on Nagasaki.", "As victory for the United States slowly approached, casualties mounted. A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies, as casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate. President Harry Truman gave the order to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, hoping that the destruction of the city would break Japanese resolve and end the war. A second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August after it appeared that the Japanese high command was not planning to surrender.

It was less powerful than the Fat Man, which was dropped on Nagasaki, but the damage and the number of victims at Hiroshima were much higher, as Hiroshima was on flat terrain, while the hypocenter of Nagasaki lay in a small valley. According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured to varying degrees.[32] Of those deaths, 20,000 were members of the Imperial Japanese Army.[33]", "On May 19, 1953, the United States government detonated the 32-kiloton (130 TJ) atomic bomb (nicknamed \"Harry\") at the Nevada Test Site.

The test was originally to confirm that the implosion-type nuclear weapon design was feasible, and to give an idea of what the actual size and effects of a nuclear explosion would be before they were used in combat against Japan. While the test gave a good approximation of many of the explosion's effects, it did not give an appreciable understanding of nuclear fallout, which was not well understood by the project scientists until well after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.", "In August 1945, B-29 Superfortresses dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki while the Soviet's invaded Manchuria.

To date, Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only two instances of nuclear weapons being used in combat. The atomic raids killed at least one hundred thousand Japanese civilians and military personnel outright, with the heat, radiation, and blast effects. Many tens of thousands would later die of radiation sickness and related cancers.[19][20] Truman promised a \"rain of ruin\" if Japan did not surrender immediately, threatening to systematically eliminate their ability to wage war.[21] On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender.[22]", "The short novel is a fictional retelling of the story of Sadako Sasaki, who lived in Hiroshima at the time of the atomic bombing by the United States, Sadako was 2 years old when the atomic bomb (Little Boy) was dropped on August 6, 1945, near her home by Salamis Bridge in Hiroshima, Japan. She was at home when the explosion occurred, about one mile from Ground Zero. In November 1954, when she was 12 she developed swellings on her neck and behind her ears. In January 1955, purple spots had formed on her legs. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with leukemia (her mother referred to it as \"an atom bomb disease\"). She was hospitalized on February 21, 1955, and given a year to live.", "On July 16, 1945, at Kirtland Field, two B-29 Superfortress observation planes had set out early in the morning with instructions from Oppenheimer to steer a course at least 15 miles west of the atomic detonation point, Trinity Site. Because of thunderstorms, the planes dropped from 23,000 to 18,000 feet before circling the Trinity Site during the first atomic bomb detonation. While \"The Gadget\" underwent field-testing at Trinity, the nuclear components for the bombs and the active materials were being sent piecemeal to Tinian. Shortly before the bomb testing at the Trinity site, components of Little Boy were driven from Los Alamos to Kirtland Field and then flown to San Francisco. This included some of the U-235. From San Francisco, they were transported to Hunters Point to board the cruiser USS\u00a0Indianapolis, bound for Tinian. Following that, the Fat Man plutonium core and its initiator were driven down to Albuquerque. They left Kirtland Field on 26 July and were flown in a C-54 Skymaster to Tinian, where they arrived 28 July. Such was Kirtland Field\u2019s last important role in the U.S. defeat of Japan, thereby ending World War II.[2]", "One class of nuclear weapon, a fission bomb (not to be confused with the fusion bomb), otherwise known as an atomic bomb or atom bomb, is a fission reactor designed to liberate as much energy as possible as rapidly as possible, before the released energy causes the reactor to explode (and the chain reaction to stop). Development of nuclear weapons was the motivation behind early research into nuclear fission which the Manhattan Project during World War II (September 1, 1939 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c September 2, 1945) carried out most of the early scientific work on fission chain reactions, culminating in the three events involving fission bombs that occurred during the war. The first fission bomb, codenamed \"The Gadget\", was detonated during the Trinity Test in the desert of New Mexico on July 16, 1945. Two other fission bombs, codenamed \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man\", were used in combat against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in on August 6 and 9, 1945 respectively.", "At 08:09, Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier, Major Thomas Ferebee.[135] The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy containing about 64\u00a0kg (141\u00a0lb) of uranium-235 took 44.4 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at about 31,000 feet (9,400\u00a0m) to a detonation height of about 1,900 feet (580\u00a0m) above the city.[136][137] Enola Gay traveled 11.5\u00a0mi (18.5\u00a0km) before it felt the shock waves from the blast.[138]", "On 6 August 1945, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress (Enola Gay) of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, piloted by Tibbets, lifted off from North Field, and Little Boy in its bomb bay. Hiroshima, the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division and a port of embarkation, was the primary target of the mission, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternatives. With Farrell's permission, Parsons, the weaponeer in charge of the mission, completed the bomb assembly in the air to minimize the risks during takeoff.[282] The bomb detonated at an altitude of 1,750 feet (530\u00a0m) with a blast that was later estimated to be the equivalent of 13 kilotons of TNT.[283] An area of approximately 4.7 square miles (12\u00a0km2) was destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6\u20137% damaged. About 70,000 to 80,000 people, of whom 20,000 were Japanese combatants and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, or some 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed immediately, and another 70,000 injured.[284][285][286]", "After major repairs and an overhaul, Indianapolis received orders to proceed to Tinian island, carrying parts and the enriched uranium[15] (about half of the world's supply of Uranium-235 at the time) for the atomic bomb Little Boy, which would later be dropped on Hiroshima.[16] Indianapolis departed San Francisco's Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on 16 July 1945, within hours of the Trinity test.", "Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive power from nuclear fission or combined fission and fusion reactions. Starting with scientific breakthroughs made during the 1930s, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada collaborated during World War II in what was called the Manhattan Project to counter the suspected Nazi German atomic bomb project. In August 1945, two fission bombs were dropped on Japan, standing to date as the only use of nuclear weapons in combat. The Soviet Union started development shortly thereafter with their own atomic bomb project, and not long after that both countries developed even more powerful fusion weapons known as \"hydrogen bombs\".", "Up An' Atom was the name of a B-29 Superfortress (B-29-36-MO 44-27304, Victor number 88) configured during World War II in the Silverplate project to carry an atomic bomb.", "The war ended with the American atomic bombing of Japan.", "Both governments spent massive amounts to increase the quality and quantity of their nuclear arsenals. Both nations quickly began the development of a hydrogen bomb and the United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb on November 1, 1952, on Enewetak, an atoll in the Pacific Ocean.[12] Code-named \"Ivy Mike\", the project was led by Edward Teller, a Hungarian-American nuclear physicist. It created a cloud 100 miles wide and 25 miles high, killing all life on the surrounding islands.[13] Again, the Soviets surprised the world by exploding a deployable thermonuclear device in August 1953 although it was not a true multi-stage hydrogen bomb. However, it was small enough to be dropped from an airplane, making it ready for use. The development of these two Soviet bombs was greatly aided by the Russian spies Harry Gold and Klaus Fuchs.", "After being selected in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing to serve as a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed.[41] While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.[37]", "RDS-1, the first Soviet atomic test was internally code-named First Lightning (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f, or Pervaya Molniya) August 29, 1949, and was code-named by the Americans as Joe 1. The design was very similar to the first US \"Fat Man\" plutonium bomb, using a TNT/hexogen implosion lens design.", "On August 6, 1945, towards the end of World War II, the Little Boy device was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500\u00a0tonnes of TNT, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Koreans.[6] Detonation of the Fat Man device exploded over the Japanese city of Nagasaki three days later on 9 August 1945, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese civilian munitions workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.[7] Subsequently, the world\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.[4]", "The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the Trinity test, conducted at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of national laboratories, supported medical research into radiology and laid the foundations for the nuclear navy. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.", "Less than a second after the detonation, the north of the city was destroyed and 35,000 people were killed.[18] Among the deaths were 6,200 out of the 7,500 employees of the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, and 24,000 others (including 2,000 Koreans) who worked in other war plants and factories in the city, as well as 150 Japanese soldiers. The industrial damage in Nagasaki was high, leaving 68\u00e2\u20ac\u201c80% of the non-dock industrial production destroyed. It was the second and, to date, the last use of a nuclear weapon in combat, and also the second detonation of a plutonium bomb. The first combat use of a nuclear weapon was the \"Little Boy\" bomb, which was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The first plutonium bomb was tested in central New Mexico, United States, on July 16, 1945. The Fat Man bomb was somewhat more powerful than the one dropped over Hiroshima, but because of Nagasaki's more uneven terrain, there was less damage.[19][20][21][22]", "RDS-3 was the third Soviet atomic bomb. On October 18, 1951, the 41.2 kiloton device was detonated - a boosted weapon using a composite construction of levitated plutonium core and a uranium-235 shell. Code named Joe 3 in the USA, this was the first Soviet air-dropped bomb test. Released at an altitude of 10\u00c2\u00a0km, it detonated 400 meters above the ground.", "Beginning in 1942 the United States, with assistance from Britain and other Allied countries, devoted considerable resources to developing nuclear weapons through the Manhattan Project. In December 1944 the USAAF's 509th Composite Group was formed under the command of Colonel Paul Tibbets to deliver these weapons once they were complete; it deployed to Tinian during May and June 1945.[224] The \"Trinity\" test of the first nuclear bomb was successfully conducted on 16\u00a0July.[225] Four days later the 509th\u00a0Composite Group's modified \"Silverplate\" B-29s began flying practice raids against Japanese cities, each armed with a single high-explosive \"pumpkin\" bomb; further practice missions took place on 24, 26 and 29\u00a0July. Japanese fighters did not attempt to intercept these aircraft, and their bombing altitude of 30,000 feet (9,100\u00a0m) was beyond the range of most anti-aircraft guns.[226] Meanwhile, on 24\u00a0July President Harry S. Truman approved the use of atomic bombs against Japan, and the next day Spaatz received written orders to this effect. These orders specified that the first attack should be made after 3\u00a0August, and named Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki as targets.[227] Kyoto, Japan's former imperial capital, had been included in an earlier version of the target list but Nagasaki was substituted on the direction of US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson owing to Kyoto's cultural value; the city had also been excluded from the urban firebombing raids on the same grounds.[228][229] On 26\u00a0July the United States, Britain and China issued the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded Japan's surrender after warning that the country would be devastated if the war continued. The Japanese government rejected the Allied demands on 28\u00a0July.[230]", "On 6 August 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the first nuclear attack in history. In a press release issued after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Truman warned Japan to surrender or \"...expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\"[172] Three days later, on 9 August, the US dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the last nuclear attack in history. More than 140,000\u2013240,000 people died as a direct result of these two bombings.[173] The necessity of the atomic bombings has long been debated, with detractors claiming that a naval blockade and aerial bombing campaign had already made invasion, hence the atomic bomb, unnecessary.[174] However, other scholars have argued that the bombings shocked the Japanese government into surrender, with Emperor finally indicating his wish to stop the war. Another argument in favor of the atomic bombs is that they helped avoid Operation Downfall, or a prolonged blockade and bombing campaign, any of which would have exacted much higher casualties among Japanese civilians.[173] Historian Richard B. Frank wrote that a Soviet invasion of Japan was never likely because they had insufficient naval capability to mount an amphibious invasion of Hokkaid\u014d.[175]"]}, {"query": "where are the mitochondria located in the sperm", "similarities": [0.8442448377609253, 0.8004104495048523, 0.7859718203544617, 0.7721384763717651, 0.7629398703575134, 0.7617954611778259, 0.7578212022781372, 0.7567394971847534, 0.7542262673377991, 0.7538720369338989, 0.7505860924720764, 0.7501986622810364, 0.7424163818359375, 0.7408287525177002, 0.7404069304466248, 0.7395876049995422, 0.73945552110672, 0.7373512983322144, 0.7327059507369995, 0.7308184504508972, 0.7296664118766785, 0.7282969355583191, 0.7281689047813416, 0.7271761894226074, 0.7271690964698792, 0.725148618221283, 0.7235070466995239, 0.7229798436164856, 0.7210057973861694, 0.7199413180351257, 0.7195740938186646, 0.7186830043792725, 0.7186163067817688, 0.7185154557228088, 0.717578649520874, 0.717242956161499, 0.7171842455863953, 0.7154812812805176, 0.7151204347610474, 0.7148916125297546, 0.7136321663856506, 0.7122639417648315, 0.7118678689002991, 0.7117831110954285, 0.7094806432723999, 0.709379255771637, 0.7091472744941711, 0.7089158296585083, 0.7087113857269287, 0.7085290551185608], "hits": ["In sexual reproduction, mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother; the mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization. Also, most mitochondria are present at the base of the sperm's tail, which is used for propelling the sperm cells; sometimes the tail is lost during fertilization. In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo.[17] Some in vitro fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an oocyte, may interfere with this.", "Motile sperm cells typically move via flagella and require a water medium in order to swim toward the egg for fertilization. In animals most of the energy for sperm motility is derived from the metabolism of fructose carried in the seminal fluid. This takes place in the mitochondria located in the sperm's midpiece (at the base of the sperm head). These cells cannot swim backwards due to the nature of their propulsion. The uniflagellated sperm cells (with one flagellum) of animals are referred to as spermatozoa, and are known to vary in size.[citation needed]", "The oocyte receives mitochondria from maternal cells, which will go on to control embryonic metabolism and apoptotic events.[6] The partitioning of mitochondria is carried out by a system of microtubules that will localize mitochondria throughout the oocyte. In certain organisms, such as mammals, paternal mitochondria brought to the oocyte by the spermatozoon are degraded through the attachment of ubiquitinated proteins. The destruction of paternal mitochondria ensures the strictly maternal inheritance of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA.[6]", "Movement of sperm is called sperm motility. The middle of the mammalian spermatozoon contains mitochondria that power the movement of the flagellum of the sperm. The motor around the base produces torque, just like in bacteria for movement through the aqueous environment.[7]", "Mitochondria are organelles found in all but one[note 1] eukaryote. Mitochondria provide energy to the eukaryote cell by converting sugars into ATP.[20] They have two surrounding membranes, each a phospholipid bi-layer; the inner of which is folded into invaginations called cristae where aerobic respiration takes place.", "The sperm's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus. This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin. Still, a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring.[11]", "Mitochondria (and related structures) are found in all eukaryotes (except one\u2014the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.).[2][62] Although commonly depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network in the majority of cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria are found in human liver cells, with about 1000\u20132000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume.[13] The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential,[63] with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes.[64] The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum.[13] Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well:[65] different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages.[66] Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum.[67] Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.[68]", "Middle piece: It has 10-14 spirals of mitochondria surrounding axial filament in the cytoplasm.

The head contains the nucleus with densely coiled chromatin fibres, surrounded anteriorly by an acrosome, which contains enzymes used for penetrating the female egg. The neck contains the sperm centriole. The midpiece has a central filamentous core with many mitochondria spiralled around it, used for ATP production for the journey through the female cervix, uterus and uterine tubes. The tail or \"flagellum\" executes the lashing movements that propel the spermatocyte.[1]", "In most multicellular organisms, mtDNA is inherited from the mother (maternally inherited). Mechanisms for this include simple dilution (an egg contains on average 200,000 mtDNA molecules, whereas a healthy human sperm was reported to contain on average 5 molecules[15][16] ), degradation of sperm mtDNA in the male genital tract, in the fertilized egg, and, at least in a few organisms, failure of sperm mtDNA to enter the egg. Whatever the mechanism, this single parent (uniparental inheritance) pattern of mtDNA inheritance is found in most animals, most plants and in fungi as well.", "Cellular respiration takes place in the cristae of the mitochondria within cells. Depending on the pathways followed, the products are dealt with in different ways.", "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or mDNA)[3] is the DNA located in mitochondria, cellular organelles within eukaryotic cells that convert chemical energy from food into a form that cells can use, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial DNA is only a small portion of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell; most of the DNA can be found in the cell nucleus and, in plants and algae, also in plastids such as chloroplasts.", "An individual's mitochondrial genes are not inherited by the same mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo.[124] Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo.[125] The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate the cells of the adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews.[126] For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species.[127][128][129] It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans.[130] There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.[131]", "When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the Fallopian tubes. Fertilization of the egg cell (ovum), usually takes place in one of the Fallopian tubes. Many sperm are released with the possibility of just one sperm cell managing to adhere to and enter the thick protective shell-like layer surrounding the ovum. The first sperm that penetrates fully into the egg donates its genetic material (DNA). The egg then polarizes, repelling any additional sperm. The resulting combination is called a zygote, a new and genetically unique organism. The term \"conception\" refers variably to either fertilization or to formation of the conceptus after its implantation in the uterus, and this terminology is controversial.", "Spermatogenesis, the process for producing spermatozoa, takes place in the seminiferous tubules. During spermatogenesis, the DNA of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules is subject to damage from such sources as reactive oxygen species.[1] The genomic integrity of spermatogenic cells is protected by DNA repair processes.[2] Deficiencies in the enzymes employed in these repair processes may lead to infertility.[2]", "The acrosomal reaction normally takes place in the ampulla of the fallopian tube (site of fertilization) when the sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte. A few events precede the actual acrosome reaction. The sperm cell acquires a \"hyperactive motility pattern\" by which its flagellum produces vigorous whip-like movements that propel the sperm through the cervical canal and uterine cavity, until it reaches the isthmus of the fallopian tube. The sperm approaches the ovum in the ampulla of the fallopian tube with the help of various mechanisms, including chemotaxis. Glycoproteins on the outer surface of the sperm then bind with glycoproteins on the zona pellucida of the ovum.", "Mitochondria stripped of their outer membrane are called mitoplasts.", "The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.[1] To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.[2] The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek \u03bc\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, mitos, \"thread\", and \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, chondrion, \"granule\"[3] or \"grain-like\". Mitochondria generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.[4]", "Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word (\u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1) sperma (meaning \"seed\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \"male\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles, stored in the epididymis, and is released from the penis.", "Seminiferous tubules are located within the testes, and are the specific location of meiosis, and the subsequent creation of male gametes, namely spermatozoa.", "The mammalian male reproductive system contains two main divisions, the penis and the testicles, the latter of which is where sperm are produced. In humans, both of these organs are outside the abdominal cavity, but they can be primarily housed within the abdomen in other animals. For instance, a dog's penis is covered by a penile sheath except when mating. Having the testicles outside the abdomen best facilitates temperature regulation of the sperm, which require specific temperatures to survive. The external location may also cause a reduction in the heat-induced contribution to the spontaneous mutation rate in male germinal tissue.[3] Sperm are the smaller of the two gametes and are generally very short-lived, requiring males to produce them continuously from the time of sexual maturity until death. The produced sperm are stored in the epididymis until ejaculation. The sperm cells are motile and they swim using tail-like flagella to propel themselves towards the ovum. The sperm follows temperature gradients (thermotaxis)[4] and chemical gradients (chemotaxis) to locate the ovum.", "The acrosome is an organelle that develops over the anterior half of the head in the spermatozoa (sperm cells) of many animals including humans. It is a cap-like structure derived from the Golgi apparatus. Acrosome formation is fully completed 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 years after testicular maturation.[citation needed] In Eutherian mammals the acrosome contains digestive enzymes (including hyaluronidase and acrosin).[1] These enzymes break down the outer membrane of the ovum, called the zona pellucida, allowing the haploid nucleus in the sperm cell to join with the haploid nucleus in the ovum.", "Spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside a Fallopian tube or the uterus.", "The main sperm function is to reach the ovum and fuse with it to deliver two sub-cellular structures: (i) the male pronucleus that contains the genetic material and (ii) the centrioles that are structures that help organize the microtubule cytoskeleton.", "Within the seminiferous tubules", "DNA damages present in sperm cells in the period after meiosis but before fertilization may be repaired in the fertilized egg, but if not repaired, can have serious deleterious effects on fertility and the developing embryo. Human sperm cells are particularly vulnerable to free radical attack and the generation of oxidative DNA damage.[7] (see e.g. 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine)", "It is the transmission of this organellar DNA that is responsible for the phenomenon of extranuclear inheritance. Both chloroplasts and mitochondria are present in the cytoplasm of maternal gametes only. Paternal gametes (sperm for example) do not have cytoplasmic mitochondria. Thus, the phenotype of traits linked to genes found in either chloroplasts or mitochondria are determined exclusively by the maternal parent.", "Fertilization takes place when the spermatozoon has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the gametes fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single diploid cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the fallopian tubes. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the mitotic division which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.", "A spermatozoon (pronounced /\u02ccsp\u025c\u02d0rm\u00e6t\u0259\u02c8zo\u028a\u0259n/, alternate spelling spermatozo\u00f6n; plural spermatozoa; from Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 \"seed\" and Ancient Greek: \u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd \"living being\") is a motile sperm cell, or moving form of the haploid cell that is the male gamete. A spermatozoon joins an ovum to form a zygote. (A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo.)", "The spermatozoa of animals are produced through spermatogenesis inside the male gonads (testicles) via meiotic division. The initial spermatozoon process takes around 70 days to complete. The spermatid stage is where the sperm develops the familiar tail. The next stage where it becomes fully mature takes around 60 days when it is called a spermatozoan.[3] Sperm cells are carried out of the male body in a fluid known as semen. Human sperm cells can survive within the female reproductive tract for more than 5 days post coitus.[4] Semen is produced in the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and urethral glands.", "The spermatozoon is characterized by a minimum of cytoplasm and the most densely packed DNA known in eukaryotes. Compared to mitotic chromosomes in somatic cells, sperm DNA is at least sixfold more highly condensed.[4]", "In the mitochondrion, the matrix is the space within the inner membrane. The word \"matrix\" stems from the fact that this space is viscous, compared to the relatively aqueous cytoplasm. The mitochondrial matrix contains the mitochondria's DNA, ribosomes, soluble enzymes, small organic molecules, nucleotide cofactors, and inorganic ions.[1] The enzymes in the matrix facilitate reactions responsible for the production of ATP, such as the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation of pyruvate and the beta oxidation of fatty acids.[1]", "For typical liver mitochondria, the area of the inner membrane is about 5x as large as the outer membrane due to cristae. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. Cristae membranes are studded on the matrix side with small round protein complexes known as F1 particles, the site of proton-gradient driven ATP synthesis. Cristae affect overall chemiosmotic function of mitochondria.[1]", "Maturation then takes place under the influence of testosterone, which removes the remaining unnecessary cytoplasm and organelles. The excess cytoplasm, known as residual bodies, is phagocytosed by surrounding Sertoli cells in the testes. The resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility, rendering them sterile. The mature spermatozoa are released from the protective Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in a process called spermiation.", "In human cells, and eukaryotic cells in general, DNA is found in two cellular locations\u00a0\u2014 inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.", "Spermatids are connected by cytoplasmic material and have superfluous cytoplasmic material around their nuclei.", "DNA damages present in spermatozoa in the period after meiosis but before fertilization may be repaired in the fertilized egg, but if not repaired, can have serious deleterious effects on fertility and the developing embryo. Human spermatozoa are particularly vulnerable to free radical attack and the generation of oxidative DNA damage.[7][8] (see e.g. 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine)", "During fertilization, a sperm must first fuse with the plasma membrane and then penetrate the female egg in order to fertilize it. Fusing to the egg usually causes little problem, whereas penetrating through the egg's hard shell or extracellular matrix can present more of a problem to the sperm. Therefore, sperm cells go through a process known as the acrosome reaction which is the reaction that occurs in the acrosome of the sperm as it approaches the egg. The acrosome is a cap-like structure over the anterior half of the sperm's head.", "During fertilization, the sperm provides three essential parts to the oocyte: (1) a signalling or activating factor, which causes the metabolically dormant oocyte to activate; (2) the haploid paternal genome; (3) the centrosome, which is responsible for maintaining the microtubule system. See anatomy of sperm", "In males, this process is known as spermatogenesis and takes place only after puberty in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The immature spermatozoon or sperm are then sent to the epididymis where they gain a tail and motility. Each of the original diploid germs cells or primary spermatocytes forms four functional gametes which is each forever young. The production and survival of sperms require a temperature that is lower than the normal core body temperature. Since the scrotum, where the testes is present, is situated outside the body cavity, it provides a temperature about 3\u00a0\u00b0C below normal body temperature.", "The inner mitochondrial membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, the area of the inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.[43]", "As the sperm approaches the zona pellucida of the egg, which is necessary for initiating the acrosome reaction, the membrane surrounding the acrosome fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm's head, exposing the contents of the acrosome. The contents include surface antigens necessary for binding to the egg's cell membrane, and numerous enzymes which are responsible for breaking through the egg's tough coating and allowing fertilization to occur.[1]", "The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place.", "In mammals, the binding of the spermatozoon to the GalT initiates the acrosome reaction. This process releases the hyaluronidase that digests the matrix of hyaluronic acid in the vestments around the oocyte. Fusion between the oocyte plasma membranes and sperm follows and allows the sperm nucleus, centriole and flagellum, but not the mitochondria, to enter the oocyte. The protein CD9 likely mediates this fusion in mice (the binding homolog). The egg \"activates\" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. Zinc atoms are released during this activation.[20]", "In eukaryotes, the enzymes in this electron transport system use the energy released from the oxidation of NADH to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes protons to build up in the intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, with the exception of anaerobic protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a hydrogenosome.[14]", "In total, the mitochondrion hosts about 3000 different types of proteins, but only about 13 of them are coded on the mitochondrial DNA. Most of the 3000 types of proteins are involved in a variety of processes other than ATP production, such as porphyrin synthesis. Only about 3% of them code for ATP production proteins. This means most of the genetic information coding for the protein makeup of mitochondria is in chromosomal DNA and is involved in processes other than ATP synthesis. This increases the chances that a mutation that will affect a mitochondrion will occur in chromosomal DNA, which is inherited in a Mendelian pattern. Another result is that a chromosomal mutation will affect a specific tissue due to its specific needs, whether those may be high energy requirements or a need for the catabolism or anabolism of a specific neurotransmitter or nucleic acid. Because several copies of the mitochondrial genome are carried by each mitochondrion (2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 in humans), mitochondrial mutations can be inherited maternally by mtDNA mutations which are present in mitochondria inside the oocyte before fertilization, or (as stated above) through mutations in the chromosomes.[citation needed]", "The spermatids begin to grow a living thread, develop a thickened mid-piece where the mitochondria become localised, and form an acrosome. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive.", "Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, usually takes place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium.[63] It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.", "Electron micrograph of human spermatozoa magnified 3140 times.", "In the case of globozoospermia (sperm with round heads), the Golgi apparatus is not transformed into the acrosome, causing male infertility.[4]"]}, {"query": "how many lines of symmetry are there in a equilateral triangle", "similarities": [0.8519250750541687, 0.7896976470947266, 0.7832594513893127, 0.7807093262672424, 0.7770407199859619, 0.7769144773483276, 0.7755935192108154, 0.7754989862442017, 0.7741138339042664, 0.769015908241272, 0.7639697790145874, 0.7630637288093567, 0.7621831297874451, 0.7607141137123108, 0.7581906318664551, 0.7579942941665649, 0.757194995880127, 0.7553862929344177, 0.753558874130249, 0.7533053159713745, 0.7512617111206055, 0.7510725855827332, 0.7509540915489197, 0.7491203546524048, 0.7489101886749268, 0.7475635409355164, 0.7470746040344238, 0.7469951510429382, 0.7461172938346863, 0.7450681328773499, 0.7448989748954773, 0.7422381639480591, 0.7421039938926697, 0.741862952709198, 0.7414816617965698, 0.7410550117492676, 0.7394692301750183, 0.7390182018280029, 0.7390182018280029, 0.738762617111206, 0.7383231520652771, 0.7378720641136169, 0.7372410893440247, 0.73656165599823, 0.7363879084587097, 0.7361499667167664, 0.735314667224884, 0.735048770904541, 0.7349695563316345, 0.7348746657371521], "hits": ["An equilateral triangle is the most symmetrical triangle, having 3 lines of reflection and rotational symmetry of order 3 about its center.

Judas also object to Jesus spending his time with Mary Magdalene (\"What's the Buzz / Strange Thing Mystifying\"), who advises Jesus to relax (\"Everything's All Right\").

After Christian is relieved of his burden, he is greeted by three angels, who give him the greeting of peace, new garments, and a scroll as a passport into the Celestial City.

Those in \"prison\" will be visited by spirits from paradise and given the chance to learn of the teachings of Jesus Christ and to accept the accompanying saving ordinances.[74] The church teaches that all persons, wicked or righteous, will be resurrected and receive an immortal, physical body.[75] The nature of that body, however, will depend on the result of the Last Judgment, at which Jesus will assign each soul to one of three degrees of glory (heavenly kingdoms): the celestial kingdom in the presence of the Father and the Son for those who accept Jesus Christ and receive all LDS saving ordinances, either as a mortal or by proxy; the terrestrial kingdom, a place of glory in the presence of Christ for righteous persons who refuse to receive the saving ordinances and for those who do not keep the covenants they commit to; and the telestial kingdom for the unrepentant wicked. A further destination, called outer darkness, is reserved for Satan, his devils, and those mortals who commit the unpardonable sin and thereby become the sons of perdition.[76] Those who are ultimately destined for the telestial kingdom will be those who suffer for their sins in hell; however, these persons remain in hell only the 1000 years during the millennial reign of Christ, after which they will exit hell and be resurrected with an immortal body into a state of peace.[76] The church also teaches that all animals have souls and, having been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, will be resurrected, along with every human child who died before the age of accountability.[77]", "The opening salutation follows a typical pattern found in other Pauline letters.

Only four of the eight last Prime Ministers have attained office as the immediate result of a general election; the others have gained office upon the resignation of a Prime Minister of their own party. The latter four were Jim Callaghan, John Major, Gordon Brown and the current Prime Minister Theresa May; these four inherited the office from Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and David Cameron respectively. In such circumstances there may not even have been an internal party leadership election, as the new leader may be chosen by acclaim, having no electoral rival (as in the case of both Brown and May).", "\u00c2\u00a0Canada\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau", "The government of Canada\u2014formally termed Her Majesty's Government[173]\u2014is defined by the constitution as the Queen acting on the advice of her Privy Council;[173][174][175][176] what is technically known as the Queen-in-Council,[8] or sometimes the Governor-in-Council,[87] referring to the governor general as the Queen's stand-in.

The longest that anyone has served in the office is 13 years, a record set by Richard Seddon. The first holder of the office, Henry Sewell, led the country for the shortest total time; his only term lasted just 13 days. The shortest term belonged to Harry Atkinson, whose third term lasted only seven days, but Atkinson served longer in total than did Sewell.[18] The youngest was Edward Stafford, who was appointed Premier in 1856, at 37 years, 40 days old.[19] The oldest was Walter Nash, who was 78 years old when he left office in 1960 (and 75 upon taking office in 1957).[18]", "\u00c2\u00a0Canada\nStephen Harper, Prime Minister", "As of August 2018, there are seven living former Prime Ministers of Canada, the oldest being John Turner (born 1929).

Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.[1]", "The Constitution Act, 1867, outlines that the governor general is responsible for summoning parliament in the Queen's name. A parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another royal proclamation calling for a new session to begin. After a number of such sessions, each parliament comes to an end via dissolution. As a general election typically follows, the timing of a dissolution is usually politically motivated, with the prime minister selecting a moment most advantageous to his or her political party. The end of a parliament may also be necessary, however, if the majority of Members of Parliament revoke their confidence in the Prime Minister's ability to govern, or the legally mandated (as per the Canada Elections Act) four-year maximum is reached; no parliament has been allowed to expire in such a fashion.", "Prime Minister Stephen Harper requested writs of election for a federal general election from Governor General David Johnston on August 2.  The official proclamations were issued on August 4.[10] The date of the vote is determined by the fixed-date Canada Elections Act.[11] At 11 weeks, the campaign was the longest in modern Canadian history.[12]", "After exiting office, former prime ministers of Canada have engaged in various pursuits.

However, there is no constitutional requirement that the Prime Minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of the federal parliament (subject to a constitutionally prescribed limit of three months), though by convention this is always the case.

However, the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power. Today, as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy, the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding, meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general, leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions.[17] As such, the prime minister, supported by the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO), controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada's system of governance, including the governor general, the Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, senators, heads of crown corporations, ambassadors to foreign countries, the provincial lieutenant governors, and approximately 3,100 other positions.

In modern Europe, Britain and Ireland stand out as the only countries where school uniform is widely adopted by state schools and generally supported by national and local governments although there is no legislation governing school uniform in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[3] There are some independent schools and state schools that do not have a school uniform policy and that pupils are at liberty to dress in a way considered to be appropriate by themselves and their parents or guardians.", "In the United States, the implementation of school uniforms began following ten years of research indicating the effectiveness of private schools. Some state-school reformers cited this research to support policies linked to private and Catholic school success. However, within the Catholic school literature, school uniforms have never been acknowledged as a primary factor in producing a Catholic school effect.[30][31] Some public-school administrators began implementing uniform policies to improve the overall school environment and academic achievement of the students. This is based on the assumption that uniforms are the direct cause of behavioral and academic outcome changes.[31]", "Many schools have a uniform for the first four grades (either the Ministry standardized issue or one of their own design), but grades V\u00e2\u20ac\u201cVIII (gymnasium) almost never have a school uniform, nor any other dress code (but rulebooks provide for basic decency).", "In the Haredi or ultra-Orthodox school system, uniforms are compulsory in essentially all girls' schools. In the vast majority of these, the style adopted by the Beit Ya'akov network is used: a sky-blue, button-down, open-collar, loose-fitting blouse with an Oxford-blue, pleated skirt which comes to just below the knee and dark stockings. In cold weather, a Yale-blue sweater may be added. A small fraction of schools alter the color scheme to pink and burgundy, while otherwise retaining the same overall appearance. In boys' schools there is usually not an identifiable school uniform, distinct from what is considered acceptable for ordinary street wear. However, the standards of acceptable street wear for boys and men in Haredi communities are so precise and exacting that in almost all cases all of the boys in a particular school will be dressed identically.", "In 1994, the Long Beach Unified School District, in Southern California, required school uniforms in all elementary and middle schools. This began a trend for uniforms in American elementary public schools, especially in urban school districts. President Clinton praised the idea in his 1996 State of the Union Address, saying that \"if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.\"[3] The adoption of school- or district-wide uniform policies (or \"standardised dress codes\", less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters) has been motivated by a need to counter \"gang clothing\" or the pressure for families to purchase upscale-label clothing (to avoid their children being ignored by \"fashion cliques\" and obligation chip ladyes), as well as to improve morale and school discipline.[citation needed]", "Internationally, there are differing views of school uniforms. In the Australian state of Queensland, Ombudsman Fred Albietz ruled in 1998 that state schools may not require uniforms.[15] In the Philippines, the Department of Education abolished the requirement of school uniforms in public schools[when defined as?].[16] In England and Wales, technically a state school may not permanently exclude students for \"breaching school uniform policy\", under a policy promulgated by the Department for Children, Schools and Families but students not wearing the correct uniform are asked to go home and change. In Scotland, some local councils (that have responsibility for delivering state education) do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities.[17] Turkey abolished mandatory uniforms in 2010.[18]", "Uniforms are compulsory for all students with very few variations from the standard model throughout the public and private school systems, including colleges and universities.", "In public schools, the uniform is usually a polo shirt for juniors and a different one for seniors and trousers or skirt. This set may be complemented by a school necktie and, typically, a v-neck jumper (pullover or sweater) or a blazer. In the summer, boys usually do not wear ties, pullovers, or blazers.

This was to allow poorer families to save money for basic needs.[49][50]", "The National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) conducted a phone survey of 755 principals in 2000, which revealed that 21% of public schools had a uniform policy; 23% had firm plans to create one.[76] However, this only accounts for those with school uniform policies and not for standardised dress codes, which provide for allowable student dress but are slightly more lax: For instance, instead of requiring everyone to wear the same shirt, or set of shirts, they may specify \"any solid collared three-button polo/oxford shirt\" and leave more specific details up to the parents. In 2007-2008, 55% of public school principals said their schools enforce a strict dress code, requiring students at least wear a collared shirt and trousers with an acceptable belt to school.[77]", "During the Soviet period, a standardised \"universal\" school uniform was worn by all schools. Originally of a military style with peaked cap and high collared tunic, by the 1980s boys wore a functional dark blue pattern with shoulder patches identifying the school. For formal occasions such as the first day of term, girls wore white lace collars and aprons dating back to the reign of Catherine the Great. During the initial post Soviet period from 1994 to 2013, the mandatory uniform policy was abandoned and pupils generally wore casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. However, uniforms were reintroduced under a new education law in September 2013.[52] Among the supporters of the new uniform law of 2013, arguments included tackling social inequality, but also putting an end to the controversial problem of whether school students are allowed to wear traditional religious clothing to school.[53]", "Brazilian school uniforms can vary widely from school. There are many schools that opt for a more elegant outfit, while others opt for a simpler one (social shirt, shorts). These \"intelligent uniforms\" are embedded with locater chips that allow computers to automatically know whether pupils have arrived in school or not. If pupils do not turn up for school or classes, automated message is sent to inform the parents accordingly. The benefit of the automated system is to curb absenteeism and class skipping. In this country, all schools, both private and public; it is the student's obligation to wear a uniform.[6]", "In the United States, a movement toward using uniforms in state schools began when Bill Clinton addressed it in the 1996 State of the Union, saying: \"If it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear uniforms.\"[7] As of 1998 approximately 25% of all U.S. public elementary, middle and junior high schools had adopted a uniform policy or were considering a policy, and two thirds were implemented between 1995 and 1997.[8]", "Stephanie Northen of The Guardian wrote that school uniforms are less controversial in the United Kingdom compared to the United States and are usually not opposed on free speech grounds.[11]", "The vast majority of schools in the former British colony adopted uniforms similar to that of British schools, while Catholic schools in Hong Kong usually follow the tradition of Catholic school uniforms. A number of older Christian girls' schools established before WWII, however, retain the heritage of using the Chinese cheongsam as their uniform,[23] such as St. Stephen's Girls' College, True Light Middle School and Heep Yunn School.

There they meet a Greek, Achaemenides, one of Ulysses' men, who has been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of Polyphemus. They take Achaemenides on board and narrowly escape Polyphemus. Shortly after, Anchises dies peacefully of old age, and Aeneas sails to Carthage.", "After the sojourn in Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where Aeneas organized funeral games to honor his father, who had died a year before. The company traveled on and landed on the western coast of Italy. Aeneas descended into the underworld where he met Dido (who turned away from him to return to her husband) and his father, who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of Rome.", "After a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at Juno's request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at Carthage after six years of wanderings. Aeneas had a year-long affair with the Carthaginian queen Dido (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. A marriage of sorts was arranged between Dido and Aeneas at the instigation of Juno, who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. Aeneas's mother Venus (the Roman adaptation of Aphrodite) realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come. However, the messenger god Mercury was sent by Jupiter and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, compelling him to leave secretly. When Dido learned of this, she uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome, an enmity that would culminate in the Punic Wars. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met.", "The Trojan survivors escape with a number of ships, seeking to establish a new homeland elsewhere. They land in several nearby countries that prove inhospitable, and are finally told by an oracle that they must return to the land of their forebears. They first try to establish themselves in Crete, where Dardanus had once settled, but find it ravaged by the same plague that had driven Idomeneus away. They find the colony led by Helenus and Andromache, but decline to remain. After seven years they arrive in Carthage, where Aeneas has an affair with Queen Dido. (Since according to tradition Carthage was founded in 814 BC, the arrival of Trojan refugees a few hundred years earlier exposes chronological difficulties within the mythic tradition.) Eventually the gods order Aeneas to continue onward, and he and his people arrive at the mouth of the Tiber River in Italy. Dido commits suicide, and Aeneas's betrayal of her was regarded as an element in the long enmity between Rome and Carthage that expressed itself in the Punic Wars and led to Roman hegemony.", "Neptune takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans, he is infuriated by Juno's intrusion into his domain, and stills the winds and calms the waters, after making sure that the winds would not bother the Trojans again, lest they be punished more harshly than they were this time. The fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa, where Aeneas rouses the spirits of his men, reassuring them that they have been through worse situations before. There, Aeneas's mother, Venus, in the form of a huntress very similar to the goddess Diana, encourages him and recounts to him the history of Carthage. Eventually, Aeneas ventures into the city, and in the temple of Juno he seeks and gains the favor of Dido, queen of the city, which has only recently been founded by refugees from Tyre and which will later become a great imperial rival and enemy to Rome.", "Book 1[16] (at the head of the Odyssean section) opens with a storm which Juno, Aeneas' enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet. The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome.

Their ship is blown off course from Sicily, and they land on the shore of North Africa, in Carthage, a town newly settled by refugees from Tyre. Aeneas falls in love with their queen, Dido, but dutifully departs for Italy leaving her.

He left a detachment of 20,000 troops to garrison the newly conquered region. At the Pyrenees, he released 11,000 Iberian troops who showed reluctance to leave their homeland. Hannibal reportedly entered Gaul with 40,000-foot soldiers and 12,000 horsemen.[20]", "In Book 6, Aeneas, with the guidance of the Cumaean Sibyl, descends into the underworld through an opening at Cumae. They pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river Acheron and are ferried across by Charon before passing by Cerberus. Then Aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in Tartarus and is warned by the Sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods. He is then brought to green fields of Elysium. There he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.", "In the Roman epic of Virgil, the Aeneid, Queen Dido, the Greek name for Elissa, is first introduced as a highly esteemed character. In just seven years, since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to Aeneas and his men, who have recently escaped from Troy. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, Mercury, sent by Jupiter, reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a pyre to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: \"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\" (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of Hannibal. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had founded, exemplified by Cato the Elder's much-repeated utterance, \"Carthago delenda est\", \"Carthage must be destroyed\".[10]", "In 205 BC, a last attempt was made by Mago to recapture New Carthage when the Roman occupiers were shaken by a mutiny and an Iberian uprising against their new overlords; the attack was repulsed. So, in the same year, Mago left Iberia, setting sail from the Balearic islands to Italy with his remaining forces.[8]", "He tells of how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: Thrace, where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, Polydorus; the Strophades, where they encounter the Harpy Celaeno, who tells them to leave her island and to look for Italy; Crete, which they believe to be the land where they are to build their city, which they name Pergamea (but they are set straight by Apollo); and Buthrotum. This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy. In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets Andromache, the widow of Hector. She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child. There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of Priam's sons, who has the gift of prophecy. Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as Ausonia or Hesperia), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world. In addition, Helenus also bids him go to the Sibyl in Cumae.", "Later in Book 6, Aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees his father Anchises, who tells him of his own destiny as well as that of the Roman people. Anchises describes how Aeneas's descendant Romulus will found the great city of Rome, which will eventually be ruled by Caesar Augustus:", "The Roman poet Virgil (70\u201319 BC) presents Dido as a tragic heroine in his epic poem the Aeneid, whose hero Aeneas travels from Troy, to Carthage, to Rome.[35] The work contains inventive scenes, loosely based on the legendary history of Carthage, e.g., referring to the then well-known story how the Phoenician Queen cunningly acquired the citadel of the Byrsa.[36][37][38] In Virgil's epic, the god Jupiter requires the hero Aeneas to leave his beloved Dido, who then commits suicide and burns in a funeral pyre.[39] This episode employs not only the history or legends narrated by Trogus (mentioned above), but perhaps also subsequent mythical and cult-based elements, as Dido would become assimilated to the Punic or Berber goddess Tanit. Each autumn a pyre was built outside the old city of Carthage; into it the goddess was thought to throw herself in self-immolation for the sake of the dead vegetation god Adonis\u2013Eshmun.[40][41]", "Virgil, the Roman epic poet, wrote, in book three of The Aeneid, of how Aeneas and his crew landed on the island of the cyclops after escaping from Troy at the end of the Trojan War.

Adherbal had similar, though less controversial, quick thoughts and ordered the evacuation of Drepana before the blockade was unavoidable. Carthage's ships thus sailed out of Drepana, passing south of the city and around two small islands in the coast to the open sea. Seeing his plan for a surprise attack fail, Pulcher ordered his fleet to regroup into battle formation. However, by then, everything was against him.

Aeneas and his men have left Carthage for Sicily, where Aeneas organizes celebratory games\u00e2\u20ac\u201da boat race, a foot race, a boxing match, and an archery contest. In all those contests, Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers, showing his leadership qualities by not allowing antagonism even after foul play. Each of these contests comments on past events or prefigures future events: the boxing match, for instance, is \"a preview of the final encounter of Aeneas and Turnus\", and the dove, the target during the archery contest, is connected to the deaths of Polites and King Priam in Book 2 and that of Camilla in Book 11.[10] Afterwards, Ascanius leads the boys in a military parade and mock battle, a tradition he will teach the Latins while building the walls of Alba Longa.", "The consul sent part of the army to various cities to winter, disbanded the forces of the Greek allies except for the Achaeans and sent Misagenes and his Numidians to the nearest cities in Thessaly. Eumenes and Attalus returned to Pergamon. He then went with part of his army south to Achaean Phthiotis where he razed Pteleum. Antronae surrendered. Livy wrote that then he went to Larissa, that the Macedonian garrison had fled and the inhabitants, who had taken refuge in the citadel, surrendered. However, he never previously mentioned that Larissa had been taken by the Macedonians and this sounds odd. After this Publius Licinius went to Boeotia, where Thebes was in trouble with another Boeotian city, Coronea, and asked for help.[26]", "Scipio sent Marcus Silianus to Tarraco and Lucius Marcius to southern Hispania. He then joined the latter as he was approaching the coast. Scipio wanted to go to Gades to meet Masinissa and conclude an alliance with him. Lucius Marcius informed Masinissa that Scipio was coming. Masinissa persuaded Mago to let him go to the mainland to for some plundering (at that time Cadiz was on an island).

The Romans made Claudius a member of the Roman senate, and conferred citizenship on the Sabines together with land on the far side of the Anio. According to Dionysius, the Romans promised them land beyond the Anio river in the vicinity of Fidenae: all they had to do was to take it from the Fidenates.

Not only was all independence of Sicily brought to an end, but the majority of the islands commercial activities were redirected toward Italy.[36] However, in 210 BC, the Senate decided to restore autonomy to Syracuse, which retained a large hinterland.[10]", "The Aeneid tells the story Aeneas and his travels to what would become Rome. On his journey he also endures strife comparable to that of Odysseus. However, the motives for both of their journeys differ as Aeneas was driven by this sense of duty granted to him by the Gods that he must abide by. He also kept in mind the future of his people, fitting for the future Father of Rome. Odysseus' journey was made with self-centered intent as he consistently engages in conflict in the pursuit of glory, take him telling the cyclops Polyphemus his real name which in turn cost him the lives of many of his crew members.[citation needed]", "Dionysius I of Syracuse ruled for 38 years and engaged in four wars against Carthage with varying results. In 398 BC, after building up the power of Syracuse while Carthage was suffering from the plague, Dionysius broke the peace treaty. His soldiers massacred the Carthaginian traders in Syracuse, and Dionysius then besieged, captured and destroyed the Carthaginian city of Motya in Western Sicily while foiling the relief effort of Himilco through a brilliant stratagem. Himilco, who had been elected \"king\", responded decisively the following year, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured Messina. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself after Mago, his kinsman, crushed the Greek fleet off Catana. The siege met with great success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed under Syracusan attack. Himilco paid an indemnity of 300 talents for safe passage of Carthaginian citizens to Dionysius. He abandoned his mercenaries and sailed to Carthage, only to commit suicide after publicly assuming full responsibility for the debacle (After his death, the power of \"kings\" would be severely curtailed, and the power of the oligarchy, ruling through the \"Council of Elders\" and the newly created \"Tribunal of 104\", correspondingly increased).[108]", "From Bononia they crossed the Channel to Britain and made their way to Eboracum (York), capital of the province of Britannia Secunda and home to a large military base. Constantine was able to spend a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the Picts beyond Hadrian's Wall in the summer and autumn.[69] Constantius's campaign, like that of Septimius Severus before it, probably advanced far into the north without achieving great success.[70] Constantius had become severely sick over the course of his reign, and died on 25 July 306 in Eboracum (York). Before dying, he declared his support for raising Constantine to the rank of full Augustus. The Alamannic king Chrocus, a barbarian taken into service under Constantius, then proclaimed Constantine as Augustus. The troops loyal to Constantius' memory followed him in acclamation. Gaul and Britain quickly accepted his rule;[71] Hispania, which had been in his father's domain for less than a year, rejected it.[72]", "Soon Jason reached the court of Phineus of Salmydessus in Thrace.

Another sailor, Hanno the Navigator, explored the Atlantic to the south, along the African coast well past the River Gambia.

From the Ebro to the Pyrenees the Carthaginians confronted four tribes, the Illergetes, the Bargusii, the Aeronosii and the Andosini. There were a number of cities here that Hannibal took, which Polybius does not specify. This campaign was conducted with speed in order to take as little time as possible in the reduction of this region. Polybius reports severe losses on Hannibal's part. Having reduced this area, he left his brother Hanno in command of this area, specifically over the Bargusii, whom he had reason to distrust due to their affiliation with the Romans.

Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard that wish, instead ordering the Aeneid to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.[13] As a result, the existing text of the Aeneid may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication.

This resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by Scipio Aemilianus. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing and enslaving the people. About 50,000 Carthaginians were sold into slavery. The city was set ablaze and then, according to tradition, it was ploughed over and salted. A new city of Carthage was built on the same land by Julius Caesar in the period from 49 to 44 BC, and by the 1st century, it had grown to be the second-largest city in the western half of the Roman Empire. It was the centre of the province of Africa. Among its major monuments was an amphitheatre. Carthage was captured in the 5th century by Genseric, king of the Vandals, a Germanic people who defeated the Roman general Bonifacius and made the city his capital. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the fifth century, the Eastern Roman Empire finally subdued the Vandals in the Vandalic War in 533\u2013534.

This hearkens back to the Thunderball soundtrack, where Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was originally proposed as the opening credits music, only to be replaced by the eponymous title track as sung by Tom Jones.[10]", "Hawaii Five-0 uses the original show theme song composed by Morton Stevens. Critics received an early copy of the pilot with a synthesizer and guitar-based version of the theme. After negative reaction to the reworked song spread quickly online, Kurtzman said he and others realized that changing the music was a mistake, and arranged for studio musicians,[65] including three who had worked on the original from 1968,[66] to rerecord the theme \"exactly as it was\", except shortened to 30 seconds[65] from its original length of about 60 seconds.[67] Original instrumental music is composed by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.[68]", "The show's theme song, \"The Ballad of Serenity\", was written by Joss Whedon and performed by Sonny Rhodes. Whedon wrote the song before the series was greenlit and a preliminary recording performed by Whedon can be found on the DVD release. The soundtrack to the series was released on CD on November 8, 2005, by Var\u00e8se Sarabande, although a 40-minute soundtrack was released by Fox Music in September 2005 as a digital EP.[38] \"The Ballad of Serenity\" was used by NASA as the wake-up song for astronaut Robert L. Behnken and the other crewmembers of STS-130 on February 12, 2010.[42]", "The theme song \"Nobody Does It Better\" was composed by Marvin Hamlisch with lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager and was performed by Carly Simon. It was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to \"You Light Up My Life\".  It was one of five Bond theme songs to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The other four were \"Live and Let Die\" in 1973, \"For Your Eyes Only\" in 1981, \"Skyfall\", and \"Writing on the Wall\". \"Skyfall\" went on to win the award in 2013 and \"Writing on the Wall\" won in 2016.", "The theme song, \"GoldenEye\", was written by Bono and the Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner.[63] As the producers did not collaborate with Bono or the Edge, the film score did not incorporate any of the theme song's melodies, as was the case in previous James Bond films.[64] Swedish group Ace of Base had also written a proposed theme song, but label Arista Records pulled the band out of the project fearing the negative impact in case the film flopped. The song was then re-written as their single \"The Juvenile\".[65]", "The instrumental score was composed by Hans Zimmer with songs by Bryan Adams in both the English and French versions of the album. The opening theme song for the film, \"Here I Am\" was written by Bryan Adams, Gretchen Peters, and Hans Zimmer. It was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Another song, not included in the film itself (although it can be heard in the ending credits), is \"Don't Let Go\", which is sung by Bryan Adams with Sarah McLachlan on harmonies and piano. It was written by Bryan Adams, Gavin Greenaway, Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and Gretchen Peters. Many of the songs and arrangements were set in the American West, with themes based on love, landscapes, brotherhood, struggles, and journeys. Garth Brooks was originally supposed to write and record songs for the film but the deal fell through. The Italian versions of the songs were sung by Zucchero. The Spanish versions of the tracks on the album were sung by Erik Rub\u00edn (Hispanic America) and Ra\u00fal (Spain). The Brazilian version of the movie soundtrack was sung in Portuguese by Paulo Ricardo. The Norwegian versions of the songs were sung by Vegard Ylvis\u00e5ker of the Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis.", "The memorable funk instrumental theme song for the show was composed by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter. Although not released on record during the show's run, it later appeared on Post's albums Television Theme Songs (1982) and NYPD Blue: The Best of Mike Post (1999).", "Barry felt it would be difficult to compose a theme song containing the title \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" unless it were written operatically, in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan.[44] Leslie Bricusse had considered lyrics for the title song[45] but director Peter R. Hunt allowed an instrumental title theme in the tradition of the first two Bond films. The theme was described as \"one of the best title cuts, a wordless Moog-driven monster, suitable for skiing at breakneck speed or dancing with equal abandon.\"[46]", "The show's theme song was created by composer/performer Stewart Copeland.", "The script was written by Bond screenwriting regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as John Logan.[285] Roger Deakins signed on as cinematographer, while Dennis Gassner returned as production designer.[286] Thomas Newman, who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead and Revolutionary Road, replaced David Arnold as composer;[287] British singer-songwriter Adele co-wrote and recorded the film's theme song with her regular songwriter, Paul Epworth.[288]", "\"The World Is Not Enough\" is the theme song from the eponymous 1999 James Bond film,  performed by American-Scottish alternative rock band Garbage. The song was written by composer David Arnold (who also scored the film) and lyricist Don Black, previously responsible for four other Bond songs, and was produced by Garbage and Arnold. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was composed in the style of the series' title songs, in contrast with the post-modern production and genre-hopping of Garbage's first two albums. The group recorded most of \"The World Is Not Enough\" while touring Europe in support of their album Version 2.0, telephoning Arnold as he recorded the orchestral backing in London before travelling to England. Garbage later finished recording and mixing the song at Armoury Studios in Canada. The lyrics reflect the film's plot (told from the viewpoint of antagonist Elektra King), with themes of world domination and seduction.", "The show's theme song, \"Final Frontier\", was composed by Reiser and Don Was. The theme was originally performed by Andrew Gold, but a version performed by Anita Baker made its debut at the beginning of the sixth season. Baker's version was used on several episodes of the last two seasons, in addition to Gold's version, and appears on the show's soundtrack album. Gold's version is available on the collection Thank You for Being a Friend: The Best of Andrew Gold.", "Although two albums of re-recorded music from the original series had previously been released under Schifrin's name, Music from Mission: Impossible (Dot, 1967) and More Mission: Impossible (Paramount, 1968) the original scores were not commercially available until 1992 when GNP Crescendo released The Best of Mission: Impossible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Then and Now[29] featuring five scores by Lalo Schifrin for the original series and five by John E.

Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in September 2014.[39] The soundtrack was recorded with small orchestral sections at British Grove Studios and with full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.[40][41]", "From Russia with Love is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer.[36] The theme song was composed by Lionel Bart of Oliver! fame and sung by Matt Monro,[37] although the title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune beginning with Barry's brief James Bond is Back then segueing into Monty Norman's \"James Bond Theme\". Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles.[37] Barry travelled with the crew to Turkey to try getting influences of the local music, but ended up using almost nothing, just local instruments such as finger cymbals to give an exotic feeling, since he thought the Turkish music had a comedic tone that did not fit in the \"dramatic feeling\" of the James Bond movies.[38]", "The Mission soundtrack was written by Ennio Morricone. Beginning with a liturgical piece (\"On Earth as It Is in Heaven\") which becomes the \"Spanish\" theme, it moves quickly to the \"Guaran\u00ed\" theme, which is written in a heavily native style and uses several indigenous instruments. Later, Morricone defines the \"Mission\" theme as a duet between the \"Spanish\" and \"Guaran\u00ed\" themes.", "Sole compositional credit for the \"James Bond Theme\" is attributed to Monty Norman, who was contracted as composer for Dr. No. Some 30 years later, in 2001, the disputed authorship of the theme was examined legally in the High Court in London after Norman sued The Sunday Times for publishing an article in 1997 in which Barry was named as the true composer; Barry testified for the defence.[29][30]", "The show's theme song entitled \"The Rockford Files\" was written by noted theme music composers, Mike Post and Pete Carpenter. It appears at the opening and ending of each episode with different arrangements. Throughout the show's tenure, the theme song went through numerous evolutions with later versions containing a distinct electric guitar-based bridge section.", "The show's title theme song was written by John Coda, who also composed the music cues to signify scene changes and commercial breaks for this series as well as Even Stevens. It was produced by Jeffrey \"Def Jef\" Fortson and Christopher B. Pearman and was performed by Raven-Symon\u00e9, Anneliese van der Pol and Orlando Brown.", "The show's theme song has become a popular standard.[citation needed] Its lyrics were written by Academy-Award winner Paul Francis Webster, with music composed by Bob Harris. The song is most recognized by its opening line, \"Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can.\"[citation needed] It was recorded at RCA Studios in Toronto, where the series was co-produced, by twelve CBC vocalists (members of the Billy Van and Laurie Bower Singers) who added to a musical backing track supplied by RCA Studios in New York.", "The theme, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", is used in the film as an action theme alternate to Monty Norman's \"James Bond Theme\", as is the case with Barry's previous \"007\" theme. \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" was remixed in 1997 by the Propellerheads for the Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project album. Barry-orchestrator Nic Raine recorded an arrangement of the escape from Piz Gloria sequence and it was featured as a theme in the trailers for Pixar's 2004 animated film The Incredibles.", "The title music was composed by John Sullivan, who was also writer of the series. The theme tune was arranged by Ronnie Hazlehurst who was a composer for many BBC sitcoms. Joan Baxter provided the vocals to the song.", "The original single release peaked at No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 19 on the magazine's Adult Contemporary chart in 1967 (Leonard Nimoy, before playing Paris in Mission Impossible in 1969, also covered the theme two years earlier).[3]", "The film music was written by Howard Goodall. It has a symphonic orchestration, a sophisticated score instead of the show's tendency to simple musical repetitions and features catchy leitmotifs for particular characters or scenes. The film's theme song was \"Crash\" by Matt Willis.", "In 2007, Oyelowo was the reader for John le Carr\u00e9's The Mission Song. AudioFile magazine stated: \"Think of David Oyelowo as a single musician playing all the instruments in a symphony. That is essentially what he manages in this inspired performance of John le Carr\u00e9's suspense novel.... Can it really have been only one man in the narrator's recording booth?

These waivers can only be requested during two periods:", "Waivers are discussed in article 13 of the collective bargaining agreement.[12] Unlike other professional leagues, waivers in the NHL do not always mean an unconditional release if a player clears waivers and elects free agency, unless the waivers requested were unconditional waivers. Most NHL players will need to clear waivers before they are assigned to a minor league team; exceptions are listed below. Clearing waivers means every other team in the NHL has the option to \"claim\" that player off of the \"waiver wire\", thus assuming his contract (and cap hit; this varies for re-entry waivers), and providing only minor monetary compensation to the originating team (unless the waivers requested were re-entry waivers); financial compensations are listed below. If a player clears waivers, the team has the right to either loan the player to a minor league affiliate which is generally a team in the American Hockey League (AHL), or the team can elect to keep that player with their club. Once a player has cleared waivers, they do not need to again clear them for the shorter of: (1) 30 cumulative days on the NHL roster; or (2) until they have played in ten NHL games. If a player refuses to report to the minors, the team can use that as grounds to suspend the player (i.e., not pay them).", "Waivers is a National Hockey League (NHL) labor management procedure by which an NHL team makes a professional ice hockey player's contract and rights available to all other NHL teams. Other NHL teams \"waive\" any claim to a player designated for assignment in the American Hockey League (AHL) or designated for release. The process is typically referred to as \"being placed on waivers.\"", "NBA teams can release a player to the waiver wire, where he can stay for 48 hours (during the regular season). While he is on waivers, other teams may claim him, for his existing salary. If he is not claimed, he is said to have \"cleared waivers\", and is treated like any free agent, able to sign with any team (with the special restriction noted above for players who were traded and then waived).", "Any player under contract may be placed on waivers (\"waived\") at any time.

Exceptions are players who have played in over 320 professional games (180 for goaltenders) and have not spent more than 80 games on an NHL roster in the past two seasons or 40 games during the previous season. The procedure to make a claim on re-entry waivers is the same; however, teams who claim players on re-entry waivers are only responsible for half the salary and cap hit, while the original team is responsible for the other half, unless the claimed player is later assigned to the AHL again before his contract has expired, in which case the salary and cap hit comes off the books of both teams.", "After a player has been designated for assignment, the other 30 NHL teams can put in a claim or waive their claim for that player. The claims process starts at noon Eastern Time and ends 24 hours later. If only one team makes a claim for the player, then he will be transferred to the claiming team. If more than one team makes a claim, then the player will be transferred to the team having the lowest percentage of possible points in league standings at the time of the request for waivers. When a waiver claim has been secured, the claiming team must pay a transfer fee to the original club, though this fee is not counted against the salary cap.

Players that pass through waivers unclaimed become free agents.[1][2]  Waiver claims are irrevocable.[1]", "There are several kinds of NHL free agency, but generally the free agent pool in the NHL is split into restricted and unrestricted free agents.

The contract specifies that the team has exclusive rights to the player playing in the NHL. Once an NHL player has played in a certain number of games or a set number of seasons has passed since the signing of his first NHL contract (see here), that player must be offered to all of the other NHL teams before he can be assigned to a minor league affiliate.[2] In the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) assignment waivers applies only to loans from an NHL club to its American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate.[3]", "If a player not on a 40-man roster has spent four years with a minor-league contract, originally signed when 19 or older or five years when signed before the age of 19, he is eligible to be chosen by any team in the rule 5 draft during the offseason.  No team is required to choose a player in the draft, but some do.  If chosen, the player must be kept on the selecting team's 25-man major league roster for the entire season after the draft\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe may not be optioned or designated to the minors.  The selecting team may, at any time, waive the rule 5 draftee, such as when they no longer wish to keep him on their major league roster.

Once a rule 5 draftee spends an entire season on his new team's 25-man roster, his status reverts to normal and he may be optioned or designated for assignment.  To prevent the abuse of the rule 5 draft, the rule also states that the draftee must be active for at least 90 days.  This keeps teams from drafting players, then \"hiding\" them on the disabled list for the majority of the season.  For example, if a rule 5 draftee was only active for 67 days in his first season with his new club, he must be active for an additional 23 days in his second season to satisfy the rule 5 requirements.", "A player who is designated for assignment (DFA) is immediately removed from the 40-man roster.

Any player can be bought out for one-third of the remaining salary if younger than age 26 at the time of termination, or two-thirds if age 26 or older, over twice the length of the remainder of their contract. Trading cash for players or agreeing to pay a portion of a player's remaining salary after trading him was forbidden in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement in order to prevent wealthier teams from evading the restrictions of the cap (this provision was eased in the 2013 collective bargaining agreement; see Trades below). It is also prohibited to renegotiate a player's contract in any way.

Because players on the 60-day DL are taken off the 40-man with no risk of losing the player, MLB teams often transfer injured players from the 10-day DL to the 60-day DL so that they can add another player to the 40-man without having to designate a player for assignment.

Writing two centuries after the event, Aristotle in his Poetics (c. 335 BCE) suggests that Thespis stepped out of the dithyrambic chorus and addressed it as a separate character. Before Thespis, the chorus narrated (for example, \"Dionysus did this, Dionysus said that\"). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character (for example, \"I am Dionysus. I did this\"). To distinguish between these different modes of storytelling\u2014enactment and narration\u2014Aristotle uses the terms \"mimesis\" (via enactment) and \"diegesis\" (via narration). From Thespis' name derives the word \"thespian\".", "The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped onto the stage at the Theatre Dionysus to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in song, dance, and in third person narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called Thespians. The exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play.[9] Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation comedies, to high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies.", "Scholars have made a number of suggestions about the way the dithyramb changed into tragedy. \"Somebody, presumably Thespis, decided to combine spoken verse with choral song. ... As tragedy developed, the actors began to interact more with each other, and the role of the chorus became smaller.[6]\" Scodell notes that:", "Aristotle writes in the Poetics that, in the beginning, tragedy was an improvisation \"by those who led off the dithyramb\",[8] which was a hymn in honor of Dionysus. This was brief and burlesque in tone because it contained elements of the Satyr play. Gradually, the language became more serious and the meter changed from trochaic tetrameter to the more prosaic iambic trimeter. In Herodotus Histories[9] and later sources,[10] the lyric poet Arion of Methymna is said to be the inventor of the dithyramb. The dithyramb was originally improvised, but later written down before performance. The Greek chorus of up to 50 men and boys danced and sang in a circle, probably accompanied by an aulos, relating to some event in the life of Dionysus.[11]", "Before the introduction of multiple, interacting actors by Aeschylus, the Greek chorus was the main performer in relation to a solitary actor.[10][11] The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century BCE, when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action. Later dramatists depended on the chorus less than their predecessors. As dialogue and characterization became more important, the chorus made less of an appearance.[5] However, historian Alan Hughes argues that there was no such thing as decline, but rather the slow dissolution of one form into another:", "Thespis (/\u02c8\u03b8\u025bsp\u026as/; Greek: \u0398\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2; fl. 6th century BC) of Icaria (present-day Dionysos, Greece), according to certain Ancient Greek sources and especially Aristotle, was the first person ever to appear on stage as an actor playing a character in a play (instead of speaking as him or herself). In other sources, he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus.[1]", "The earliest known examples of protagonist are dated back to Ancient Greece. At first dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. But then in Poetics, Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of having one actor step out and engage in a dialogue with the chorus. This invention of tragedy occurred about 536 B.C.[4] Then the poet Aeschylus, in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. Sophocles then wrote plays that required a third actor.[5][6][7][8]", "When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like Thespis had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the chorus.[26] Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role.[26] He is sometimes credited with introducing skenographia, or scene-decoration,[39] though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (cothurni) to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the Eumenides, the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.[40]", "McKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre, as Roper in A Man for All Seasons, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's Cymbeline had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[24][26]", "Mayhew got his first acting job in 1976 when the producers of Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger discovered him from a photograph in a newspaper article about men with large feet, and cast him in the role of the minotaur.[5][6]", "Booth made his stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855 in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre.[23][24][25] The audience jeered at him when he missed some of his lines.[23][26] He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently.[27] In 1857, he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, where he played for a full season.[28] At his request, he was billed as \"J.B. Wilkes\", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison with other members of his famous thespian family.[23][29] Jim Bishop wrote that Booth \"developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him.\"[26] In February 1858, he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and stumbled over his line. Instead of introducing himself by saying, \"Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo\", he stammered, \"Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet\u2014Pedolfio Pat\u2014Pantuchio Ped\u2014dammit! Who am I?\", causing the audience to roar with laughter.[23][30]", "Greek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when Thespis was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the exarchon, or leader,[4] of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural Dionysia. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the \"Father of Tragedy\"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman Solon, for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of Homer's epics by rhapsodes were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC.[5] Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer \u00e2\u20ac\u201d i.e., a \"thespian.\"", "After auditioning and landing a spot touring with the Leonard DePaur Infantry Chorus (of which he was a civilian member from 1945 to 1947), however, he officially quit CCNY. Peters often joked that he \"grew up\" in the chorus, as his vocal range changed from baritone to bass baritone during his years with them. DePaur subsequently gave him the lead in the Chorus' popular rendition of \"John Henry\" (which became a repertoire mainstay of Peters in later years, singing the work on one of his two solo albums produced by United Artists Records in the 1960s). Peters at that time with the Chorus was still performing under the name of George Fisher, but was encouraged by his agent to change it to something a bit more memorable. Future African American entrepreneur Peter Brock was a childhood friend and as he had always liked the name, Peters merely switched the order and presented the idea to his agent. After auditioning and landing a stage role in the touring company of Porgy and Bess in 1949 on the great contralto Etta Moten's suggestion, he went on tour with the opera, where the opera's statesman as Porgy, William Warfield, commended his performances and requested Peters as his understudy. It was during this time touring in Europe with the opera that celebrated African American actor-singer-activist Paul Robeson saw him in his career-defining role as \"Crown\" and purportedly declared him \"a young Paul Robeson\".", "He broadened his acting career by performing as an operatic baritone and a singer in Broadway musicals.  He can also be heard as the Speaker in Arnold Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder, in a 1979 live performance with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.", "Poitier joined the North American Negro Theater, but was rejected by audiences. Contrary to what was expected of black actors at the time, Poitier's tone deafness made him unable to sing.[26] Determined to refine his acting skills and rid himself of his noticeable Bahamian accent, he spent the next six months dedicating himself to achieving theatrical success. On his second attempt at the theater, he was noticed and given a leading role in the Broadway production Lysistrata, for which, though it ran a failing four days, he received an invitation to understudy for Anna Lucasta.[27]  By the end of 1949, he had to choose between leading roles on stage and an offer to work for Darryl F. Zanuck in the film No Way Out (1950). His performance in No Way Out, as a doctor treating a Caucasian bigot (played by Richard Widmark), was noticed and led to more roles, each considerably more interesting and more prominent than those most African American actors of the time were offered. In 1951, he traveled to South Africa with the African American actor Canada Lee to star in the film version of Cry, the Beloved Country. [28] Poitier's breakout role was as a member of an incorrigible high school class in Blackboard Jungle (1955)[29].", "From the ranks of the fraternity have come a number of pioneers in various fields. Honorary member Kelly Miller was the first African American to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University. Todd Duncan was the first actor to play \"Porgy\" in Porgy and Bess. During the Washington run of Porgy and Bess in 1936, the cast \u2014 as led by Todd Duncan \u2014 protested the audience's segregation. Duncan stated that he \"would never play in a theater which barred him from purchasing tickets to certain seats because of his race.\" Eventually management would give into the demands and allow for the first integrated performance at the National Theatre.[128]", "In 1929 the silent era of film was coming to an end, and many actors saw their careers decline with the advent of sound.[63] Many silent film actors failed to make the transition because they decided their prime duty was to tell stories in words or they overemphasized their speech. Laurel and Hardy avoided this pitfall because they continued making primarily visual films.[64] They did not ignore sound but were not ruled by it.[64] As a team they proved skilful in their melding of visual and verbal humor and made a seamless transition to the talking era in their first sound film Unaccustomed As We Are from 1929.[65] The title took its name from the familiar phrase \"Unaccustomed as we are to public speaking\".[66] In the opening dialogue, Laurel and Hardy began by spoofing the slow and self-conscious speech of the early talking actors which became a routine they would use regularly.[67]", "In his memoir, Run-Through, Houseman wrote about the circumstances surrounding the opening night at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. All the performers had been enjoined not to perform on stage for the production when it opened on July 14, 1937. The cast and crew left their government-owned theatre and walked 20 blocks to another theatre, with the audience following. No one knew what to expect; when they got there Blitzstein himself was at the piano and started playing the introduction music. One of the non-professional performers, Olive Stanton, who played the part of Moll, the prostitute, stood up in the audience, and began singing her part. All the other performers, in turn, stood up for their parts. Thus the \"oratorio\" version of the show was born. Apparently, Welles had designed some intricate scenery, which ended up never being used. The event was so successful that it was repeated several times on subsequent nights, with everyone trying to remember and reproduce what had happened spontaneously the first night. The incident, however, led to Houseman being fired and Welles's resignation from Project No. 891.[citation needed]", "Hough's earliest theater work include playing the lead in Jesus Christ Superstar at the Millfield Theatre, and dancing in the company in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the London Palladium.[84]", "The success of his acting placed him in elite social circles[81] and his ascension to fame, which was forcefully aided by Essie,[82] had occurred at a startling pace.[83] Essie's ambition for Robeson was a startling dichotomy to his indifference.[84] She quit her job, became his agent, and negotiated his first movie role in a silent race film directed by Oscar Micheaux, Body and Soul.[85] To support a charity for single mothers, he headlined a concert singing spirituals.[86] He performed his repertoire of spirituals on the radio.[87]", "His sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night,[21] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their Macbeth and Wigan High School for Girls' production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[22]", "In the early 18th century, the Dryden/Davenant/Shadwell version dominated the stage. Ariel was\u2014with two exceptions\u2014played by a woman, and invariably by a graceful dancer and superb singer. Caliban was a comedian's role, played by actors \"known for their awkward figures\". In 1756, David Garrick staged another operatic version, a \"three-act extravaganza\" with music by John Christopher Smith.[50]", "Hill made his first Broadway stage appearance in Ben Hecht's A Flag Is Born in 1946, which also featured a young Marlon Brando.[6] Hill said that his big break came when he landed a small part in the hit Broadway show Mister Roberts.[6] \"The director, Joshua Logan, thought I had some ability, and he let me create one of the scenes,\" said Hill.[6] \"So, I improvised dialog and it went in the show. That was my first endorsement. It gave me tremendous encouragement to stay in the business.\"[6] Hill said this was a thrilling time in his life when, fresh out of the Navy, he played the hapless sailor Stefanowski.[9] \"You could almost smell it from the very first reading that took place; this is going to be an overwhelming hit,\" said Hill.[9] \"We all felt it and experienced it and were convinced of it, and we were riding the crest of a wave from the very first day of rehearsals.\"[9]", "In 1981, while at Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored and starred in the play How It All Began,[12] which was performed at the Public Theater at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kilmer turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film The Outsiders, as he had prior theatre commitments.[13] In 1983 he appeared off Broadway in The Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode of ABC Afterschool Special called One Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;[14] it also starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled My Edens After Burns, that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, and expensive; even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.[15][16][17]", "The earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of King James in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century.[21] In 1701, George Granville staged a successful adaptation, titled The Jew of Venice, with Thomas Betterton as Bassanio. This version (which featured a masque) was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish Gobbos[22] in line with neoclassical decorum; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio, and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene. Thomas Doggett was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. Rowe expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.", "By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (collegium poetarum) had been formed.[24] The Roman comedies that have survived are all fabula palliata (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence).[25] In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).[26] The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping.[26]", "There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.[citation needed] A common descent from pre-Hellenic fertility and burial rites has been suggested.[citation needed] Friedrich Nietzsche discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book The Birth of Tragedy (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like satyrs in the original dithyrambs from which the tragic genre developed.", "Aldridge's first professional appearance was in the part of Kenneth in French without Tears, at the Palace Theatre, Watford, in August 1939.

Then he portrayed Philinte in Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre.[13]", "He got his start on stage while in the Army. After earning a master's degree in theater and speech from the University of Michigan, he became known in New York City for serious drama, including Ibsen, Shaw, and Chekov. His first notable role was that of Conrad in the Sir John Gielgud production of Much Ado About Nothing. In the mid-1960s, he moved his family to Los Angeles, where he played one of the Three Wise Men in the biblical epic The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965).[2]", "According to Plutarch, when Demosthenes first addressed himself to the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, \"which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess\".[31] Some citizens, however, discerned his talent. When he first left the ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus encouraged him, saying his diction was very much like that of Pericles.[32] Another time, after the ecclesia had refused to hear him and he was going home dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a friendly conversation with him.[33]", "In 2005, Lithgow became the first actor ever to deliver a commencement speech at Harvard University[29] and received an honorary Doctor of Arts from his alma mater.[30][31][32] He was featured at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6, 2009 for performances of Mozart's Requiem with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. He narrated some letters written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, some poems, and sections from the Book of Revelation in certain parts of the performance.[33]", "It is implied that Thespis invented acting in the Western world, and that prior to his performances, no one had ever assumed the resemblance of another person for the purpose of storytelling. In fact, Thespis is the first known actor in written plays. He may thus have had a substantial role in changing the way stories were told and inventing theatre as we know it today. In reverence to Thespis, actors in the English-speaking part of the world have been referred to as thespians.", "In 1951 McCallum became assistant stage manager of the Glyndebourne Opera Company. He began his acting career doing boy voices for BBC Radio in 1947[4] and began taking bit parts in British films from the late 1950s. His first acting role was in Whom the Gods Love, Die Young playing a doomed royal.[5] A James Dean-themed photograph of McCallum caught the attention of the Rank Organisation, who signed him in 1956.[6] However, in an interview with Alan Titchmarsh broadcast on 3 November 2010, McCallum stated that he had actually held his Equity card since 1946.[7]", "Silent-film actors emphasized body language and facial expression so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or campy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. Vaudeville was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors.[2] The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: \"The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures\". In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.[20]", "MacLachlan was introduced to stage acting by his mother when she became director of a youth theater program for teenagers that she helped set up in Yakima.[5][6] She also sent him to piano lessons from age 9 to 14, when he also began to study classical singing.[6][13] While in high school, he performed in plays and in class musicals, acting in his first play at age 15.[4][6] In 1982, he graduated cum laude with a BFA in drama from the University of Washington, as a student of the Professional Actor Training Program.[1][14][15] He initially planned to major in business[6] and also studied classical voice at UW,[16] before focusing on acting.[6] He moved to Los Angeles in 1985 after the release of the movie Dune in 1984,[6][17] where he made his film debut in the starring role.[6][18]", "Ferdinand Fleck, notable as the first German actor to present Shakespeare's tragic roles in their fullness, played Macbeth at the Berlin National Theatre from 1787. Unlike his English counterparts, he portrayed the character as achieving his stature after the murder of Duncan, growing in presence and confidence: thereby enabling stark contrasts, such as in the banquet scene, which he ended babbling like a child.[84]", "In a 2009 interview with The A.V. Club, Charles Napier recalled auditioning for the part of Adam, which was his first guest starring role. He won the part by jumping onto a table and singing \"The House Of The Rising Sun\" in front of others trying for the part.[4]", "Among Sophocles' earliest innovations was the addition of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters.[6] Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles' early career, followed suit and adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life.[6] Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of skenographia, or scenery-painting. It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens.[2]", "Although One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is frequently cited as Dourif's film debut, his first acting for screen was in a low-budget film called Split, which was never released. He followed this with a role in the film W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), but his bit part was omitted from the final cut of the film.[10] His portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Cuckoo's Nest ended up being his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award (Best Actor Debut) and a British Academy Award (Supporting Actor) as well as a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[6]", "All surviving works of Greek drama were composed by playwrights from Athens and are written exclusively in the Attic dialect.[22] Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states.[23] The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama[24] by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus.[25] Later playwrights expanded the number of actors to three, allowing for greater freedom in storytelling.[26]", "Other roles gave more scope for his acting abilities. In 1999's Extremely Dangerous, his character walked a fine line between villain and hero.[23] He became a repentant, poetry-reading Grammaton cleric who succumbs to his emotions in 2002's Equilibrium, a quirky alien cowboy in 2003's The Big Empty, and a sympathetic and cunning Odysseus in the 2004 film Troy. He appeared with other Hollywood stars in Moby's music video \"We Are All Made of Stars\" in February 2002.[24] In the same year, he returned to the stage in London performing in Macbeth.[25] Due to popular demand, the production ran until March 2003.", "When Laurence Olivier gave his acclaimed performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre in 1964, he had developed a case of stage fright that was so profound that when he was alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves.[49] This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film \u2013 Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards. Olivier was among the last white actors to be greatly acclaimed as Othello, although the role continued to be played by such performers as Donald Sinden at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979\u20131980, Paul Scofield at the Royal National Theatre in 1980, Anthony Hopkins in the BBC Television Shakespeare production (1981), and Michael Gambon in a stage production at Scarborough directed by Alan Ayckbourn in 1990. Gambon had been in Olivier's earlier production. In an interview Gambon commented \"I wasn't even the second gentleman in that. I didn't have any lines at all. I was at the back like that, standing for an hour. [It's] what I used to do \u2013 I had a metal helmet, I had an earplug, and we used to listen to The Archers. No one knew. All the line used to listen to The Archers. And then I went and played Othello myself at Birmingham Rep I was 27. Olivier sent me a telegram on the first night. He said, \"Copy me.\" He said, \"Do what I used to do.\" Olivier used to lower his voice for Othello so I did mine. He used to paint the big negro lips on. You couldn't do it today, you'd get shot. He had the complete negro face. And the hips. I did all that. I copied him exactly. Except I had a pony tail. I played him as an Arab. I stuck a pony tail on with a bell on the end of it. I thought that would be nice. Every time I moved my hair went wild.\"[50] British blacking-up for Othello ended with Gambon in 1990, however the Royal Shakespeare Company didn't run the play at all on the main Stratford stage until 1999, when Ray Fearon became the first black British actor to take the part, the first black man to play Othello with the RSC since Robeson.[51]", "Poitier was the first male actor of Bahamian descent to be nominated for a competitive Academy Award (for The Defiant Ones, 1958). He was also the first actor of Bahamian descent to win the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Lilies of the Field in 1963). (James Baskett was the first African American male to receive an Oscar, an Honorary Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus in the Walt Disney production of Song of the South in 1948, while Hattie McDaniel predated them both, winning as Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1939's Gone with the Wind, making her the first person of African descent to be nominated for and receive an Oscar). His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him from asking for more substantive considerations afterward.[30] Poitier worked relatively little over the following year; he remained the only major actor of African descent and the roles offered were predominantly typecast as a soft-spoken appeaser.[31]", "Plutarch, in the Life of Cimon, recounts the first triumph of the young talented Sophocles against the famous and hitherto unchallenged Aeschylus.[17] This competition ended in an unusual manner, without the usual draw for the referees, and caused the voluntary exile of Aeschylus to Sicily. Many innovations were introduced by Sophocles, and earned him at least twenty triumphs.[18] He introduced a third actor, increased the number of chorus members to fifteen; he also introduced scenery and the use of scenes.", "This theatrical act was one of the first shock rock performances.[10]", "The first choruses included lines such as", "In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, Every Man in His Humour, capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with An Humorous Day's Mirth. William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with Every Man out of His Humour, a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.[citation needed]"]}, {"query": "who sings jungle book i wanna be like you", "similarities": [0.8137481212615967, 0.7505340576171875, 0.7371754050254822, 0.736179769039154, 0.7289260625839233, 0.712416410446167, 0.7090648412704468, 0.6882043480873108, 0.6880480647087097, 0.6766611933708191, 0.6692520976066589, 0.6628556251525879, 0.6611708402633667, 0.6611229181289673, 0.6581546664237976, 0.65793776512146, 0.6542834639549255, 0.6522887349128723, 0.652062714099884, 0.6516351103782654, 0.6489349007606506, 0.6483076214790344, 0.6477820873260498, 0.6459071040153503, 0.6441853642463684, 0.6440104842185974, 0.6437664031982422, 0.6429927945137024, 0.6424859166145325, 0.6422925591468811, 0.6419139504432678, 0.6414781808853149, 0.6408646106719971, 0.6385895013809204, 0.636766791343689, 0.6360708475112915, 0.6353689432144165, 0.6339826583862305, 0.6335799694061279, 0.633556604385376, 0.6332753896713257, 0.6329247951507568, 0.6326020359992981, 0.6317625641822815, 0.6304908990859985, 0.6303867697715759, 0.6294630765914917, 0.6281461119651794, 0.6280413269996643, 0.6272679567337036], "hits": ["\"I Wan'na Be like You\" is a song from Walt Disney's 1967 film The Jungle Book.

A reprise of the song was sung by Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera and Phil Harris as Baloo at the end of the film. Van Dyke Parks worked on the arrangement, which was his first paid gig after moving to California. The song was also sung by Louis Armstrong. In 1967, \"The Bare Necessities\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. A hip-hop version of the song performed by Lou Rawls was used as the theme song for Jungle Cubs.[citation needed]", "The Jungle Book was released on October 18, 1967, to positive reception, with acclaim for its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the Sherman Brothers and one by Gilkyson, \"The Bare Necessities\". The film grossed over $23.8 million worldwide in its first release,[4] and as much again from two re-releases. Disney released a live-action remake in 1994 and an animated sequel, The Jungle Book 2, in 2003; another live-action adaptation directed by Jon Favreau was released in 2016.", "Actress/Singer Bernadette Peters performs a cover of the song in the Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle (Season 2, Episode 4, \"Touch\u00e9 Maestro, Touch\u00e9\") [5]", "The song appears in the Broadway show and is performed by Scott Irby-Ranniar, Kajuana Shuford, and Geoff Hoyle on the 1997 Original Cast Recording. In the Spanish language version of The Lion King, \"I Just Can't Wait to be King\" was performed by Mexican singer and entertainer Kalimba. Elton John himself also recorded his own version of the song for the film's soundtrack.", "Richard Sherman said he and his brother aimed for a jazz sound, with a Dixieland-like melody. He added that \"When we first got an idea for 'I Wan'na Be Like You,' we said an ape swings from a tree, and he's the king of apes. We'll make him 'the king of the swingers.' That's the idea, we'll make him a jazz man.\" Once Prima was invited to do the song, he mockingly responded to the Shermans with \"You want to make a monkey out of me? You got me!\" The instrumentals were originally recorded by Prima\u2014who also played the trumpet\u2014and his band, Sam Butera & The Witnesses, but the music was replaced by one written by the film's composer, George Bruns, and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. The \"scat dialogue\" between Baloo and King Louie was the result of two recording sessions. Louis Prima recorded first, with the intent that Baloo\u2014played in his recording by Butera\u2014would simply repeat what Louie scatted, but Phil Harris decided not to imitate Prima's recording and made up his own. The song was released the same date as the motion picture itself.[2][3]", "There are two video games based on the film: The Jungle Book was a platformer released in 1993 for Master System, Mega Drive, Game Gear, Super NES, Game Boy and PC. A version for the Game Boy Advance was later released in 2003.[54] The Jungle Book Groove Party was a dance mat game released in 2000 for PlayStation and PlayStation 2.[55][56] Kaa and Shere Khan have also made cameo appearances in another Disney video game, Quackshot.[57] A world based on the film was intended to appear more than once in the Square Enix-Disney Kingdom Hearts video game series, but was omitted both times, first in the first game because it featured a similar world based on Tarzan,[58] and second in Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, although areas of the world are accessible via hacking codes.[59]", "The Jungle Book is a 1967 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions.

It was partially rewritten with a different instrument arrangement, but remains very similar to the original. This version of the song was released as a single with \"He Lives in You\" as a B-side and was ultimately used in the Broadway theatrical version of The Lion King.", "In the 1998 Disney/Pixar film A Bug's Life, one of the characters references the song's title.

The latter song, which is performed by Nathan Lane in the film, is largely based on a cut song from The Lion King titled \"The Warthog Rhapsody,\" with which it shares a similar melody. The film features the song Hakuna Matata from the first film, which is featured both as the original soundtrack recording in the soundtrack album and in the film as a new cover performed by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella. The soundtrack also consists of various covers of pop songs, such as Hugh Masekela's Grazing in the Grass performed by Raven-Symon\u00e9, Kool and the Gang's Jungle Boogie performed by Drew K. and The French, and The Lion Sleeps Tonight (which appears briefly in the original film as well) performed by Lebo M. and Vinx.

In the film the song is sung by Timon (a meerkat voiced by Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (a warthog voiced by Ernie Sabella), and Simba, a young lion voiced by Jason Weaver (singing voice as a cub) and Joseph Williams (as an adult). Taking place after the death of Mufasa, it features (Timon and Pumbaa), the two main comedy characters in the film, talking to Simba about moving forward from their troubled pasts and forgetting their worries, and Simba grows from cub to adult as the song progresses. The song also provides a backstory for Pumbaa, explaining that he was ostracized from animal society for his excessive flatulence. It makes use of a large proportion of the orchestra as well as many other more unusual instruments including an elaborate drum kit. Rice is said to have got the idea for the lyrics for the song from watching the comedy series Bottom and at one point wanted the show's stars Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to play Timon and Pumbaa.", "Also, many songs from the musical were reordered in the film, mostly to accommodate character and storyline changes. \"We Built This City\", in its original mash-up form, and \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" were originally much earlier in the musical, giving depth to Regina. They were replaced with \"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\", another song sung by Regina in the musical, which now served to give more background to new character Patricia (as Regina was cut from the film), with both songs (in an abridged form) instead added to the climax of the film, as part of an anthem between Lonny and the rockers and Patricia and her conservative church group. \"I Wanna Rock\", originally the fourth song of the musical, was moved to after \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" (which in itself was changed from a duet between Sherrie and Jaxx to Jaxx and new character Constance), with the song now representing Drew's anger toward what he wrongly perceives to be Sherrie's infidelity. \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" and \"More Than Words/Heaven\" switched order in the film version, in order to accommodate the changes in the relationship storyline between Drew and Sherrie. \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" was also placed before \"Any Way You Want It\" due to the restructure of storylines.", "After 1987's Characters album, Wonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace. He recorded a soundtrack album for Spike Lee's film Jungle Fever in 1991. From this album, singles and videos were released for \"Gotta Have You\", \"Fun Day\"(remix only), \"These Three Words\" and \"Jungle Fever\" . The B-side to the \"Gotta Have You\" single was \"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\", which was played during the end credits of the movie Jungle Fever but was not included on the soundtrack. A piano and vocal version of \"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\" was also released on the Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal compilation. Conversation Peace and the live album Natural Wonder were released in the 1990s.[55]", "In 1968, Disneyland Records released the album More Jungle Book, an unofficial sequel also written by screenwriter Larry Simmons, which continued the story of the film, and included Phil Harris and Louis Prima voicing their film roles. In the record, Baloo (Harris) is missing Mowgli (Ginny Tyler), so he teams up with King Louie (Prima) and Bagheera (Dal McKennon) to take him from the man village.[45] On February 14, 2003, DisneyToon Studios in Australia released a film sequel, The Jungle Book 2, in which Mowgli runs away from the man village to see his animal friends, unaware that Shere Khan is more determined to kill him than ever.[46] In 2005, screenwriter Robert Reece pitched Jungle Book 3 to Disney execs.

Richard Sherman confirmed this fact on the audio commentary on its 2007 DVD release.

Ideas for a cross-Channel fixed link appeared as early as 1802,[127][128] but British political and press pressure over compromised national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel.[129] The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and was opened by British Queen Elizabeth II and French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in a ceremony held in Calais on 6 May 1994. The same year the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Channel Tunnel as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World.[130]", "The first international cable landing on New Zealand soil was that laid in 1876 from La Perouse, New South Wales to Wakapuaka, New Zealand. The major part of that cable was renewed in 1895 and it was withdrawn from service in 1932. A second trans-Tasman submarine cable was laid in 1890 between Sydney and Wellington, New Zealand and then in 1901 the Pacific cable from Norfolk Island was landed in Doubtless Bay, North Island. In 1912 a 2,270\u00a0km (1,225\u00a0nmi) cable was laid from Sydney to Auckland.[35]", "The Thames Tunnel is an underwater tunnel, built beneath the River Thames in London, connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping. It measures 35\u00a0feet (11\u00a0m) wide by 20\u00a0feet (6\u00a0m) high and is 1,300\u00a0feet (396\u00a0m) long, running at a depth of 75\u00a0feet (23\u00a0m) below the river surface measured at high tide. It was the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a navigable river[1] and was built between 1825 and 1843 using Marc Isambard Brunel's and Thomas Cochrane's newly invented tunnelling shield technology, by Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel.", "An oceanographic survey in Bulldog for the laying of a submarine telegraph cable in the North Atlantic.", "Following the failure of the first short lived Transatlantic telegraph cable of 1858, a second, more durable cable was completed in 1865, connecting Nova Scotia to England. By 1890 there was an international telegraph network.[197]", "O'Shaughnessy's experimental set-up of 1851\u201352 consisted of both overhead and underground lines; the latter included underwater ones that crossed two rivers, the Hooghly and the Haldi. The overhead line was constructed by welding uninsulated iron rods, 13\u00bd feet long and 3/8\u00a0inch wide, end to end. These lines, which weighed 1,250 pounds per mile, were held aloft by fifteen-foot lengths of bamboo, planted into the ground at equal intervals\u2014200 to the mile\u2014and covered with a layer each of coal tar and pitch for insulation. The underwater cables had been manufactured in England and consisted of copper wire covered with gutta-percha. Furthermore, in order to protect the cables from dragging ship anchors, the cables were attached to the links of a 7\u20448-inch-thick (22\u00a0mm) chain cable. An underwater cable of length 2,070 yards was laid across the Hooghly river at Diamond Harbour, and another, 1,400 yards long, was laid across the Haldi at Kedgeree.", "The Army had a history of submarine cable work by the time of World War II operations, dating back to the 1899-1900 period.[53] Much of this work had been in relation to communications with far flung Army forces in the Philippines and Alaska.[54] The Army Signal Corps used a number of cable ships for that work including Burnside, Romulus, Liscum, Dellwood and two vessels intimately associated with the Coast Artillery Corps controlled mine work at the coastal fortifications; Cyrus W. Field and Joseph Henry. That cable laying capability had been allowed to deteriorate to the point that the Army had to charter the C.S. Restorer in 1941.[55]", "The first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, and in 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was laid out from a barque in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a gale rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a steamboat was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.[5]", "Between 1886 and 1900, proposals for a link to Scotland were \"seriously explored by engineers, industrialists, and Unionist politicians\".[16] In 1885, Irish Builder and Engineer said a tunnel under the Irish Sea had been discussed \"for some time back\".[17] In 1890, engineer Luke Livingston Macassey outlined a Stranraer\u2013Belfast link by tunnel, submerged \"tubular bridge\", or solid causeway.[18] In 1897 a British firm applied for \u00a315,000 towards the cost of carrying out borings and soundings in the North Channel to see if a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland was viable.[19] The link would have been of immense commercial benefit, was significant strategically and would have meant faster transatlantic travel from Britain, via Galway and other Irish ports. When Hugh Arnold-Foster asked in the Commons in 1897 about a North Channel tunnel, Arthur Balfour said \"the financial aspects ... are not of a very promising character\".[20]", "The first successful tunnel under the Thames was started by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel in 1823, 0.75 miles (1,200\u00c2\u00a0m) upstream, assisted by his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel (who also nearly died in a tunnel collapse). Marc Brunel finally completed it in 1843, the delays being due to problems with funding.", "The surveying in 1958\u201359 catered for immersed tube and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964\u201365 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70\u00a0boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high permeability was located just south of Dover harbour.[61]", "Although there were various plans for submersibles or submarines during the Middle Ages, the Englishman William Bourne designed one of the first prototype submarines in 1578. This was to be a completely enclosed boat that could be submerged and rowed beneath the surface. Comprising a completely enclosed wooden vessel sheathed in waterproofed leather, it was to be submerged by using hand operated wooden screw thread adjustable plungers pressing against flexible leather bags located at the sides in order to increase or decrease the volume of water to adjust the buoyancy of the craft. The sketch (left) suggests that the depth adjustment was by means of a crankset projecting above the surface. There is no obvious accommodation for crew.[2] The first submersible to be actually built in modern times was constructed in 1605 by Magnus Pegelius. Its fate was to become buried in mud.[3] In 1596 the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his Secret Inventions the following: \"These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform.\" It's unclear whether or not Napier ever carried out his plans. Henry Briggs, who was professor of mathematics at Gresham College, London, and later at Oxford, was a friend of Napier, whom he visited in 1615 and 1616, and was also an acquaintance of Cornelius Van Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England, who designed and built the first successful submarine in 1620. Hence, it is not impossible that it was because of the interest taken by Napier in the submarine that Briggs came in touch with Drebbel.[4]", "Before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866. Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by Isambard Kingdom Brunel's ship SS\u00a0Great Eastern, captained by Sir James Anderson.[4] In the 1870s duplex and quadruplex transmission and receiving systems were set up that could relay multiple messages over the cable.[citation needed]", "Beginning in 1916, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle and other scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately led to the development of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.[43][44]", "In the 1840s and 1850s several individuals proposed or advocated construction of a telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean, including Edward Thornton and Alonzo Jackman.[1] Cyrus West Field and the Atlantic Telegraph Company were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.[2] The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to the President of the United States James Buchanan on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when Wildman Whitehouse applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.[3] The cable's rapid failure undermined public and investor confidence and delayed efforts to restore a connection. A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.", "Early experiments with the use of sound to 'echo locate' underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation began in the late 19th century. The first patent for an underwater echo ranging device was filed by English meteorologist Lewis Richardson a month after the sinking of the Titanic.[47] The First World War stimulated research in this area. The British made early use of underwater hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915 using quartz. In 1916, under the British Board of Invention and Research, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A B Wood, producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917. This work, for the Anti-Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff, was undertaken in utmost secrecy, and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world's first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus.", "From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line.[53] In 1896, there were thirty cable laying ships in the world and twenty-four of them were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world's cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent.[54] During World War I, Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.[53]", "From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system.

A complete map was published in 2009[13] using these previous results with high quality mapping obtained in 2006 (by researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland who are project partners in this study.)", "Robert Vazie, another Cornish engineer, was selected by the Thames Archway Company in 1805 to drive a tunnel under the River Thames at Rotherhithe. Vazie encountered serious problems with water influx, and had got no further than sinking the end shafts when the directors called in Trevithick for consultation. The directors agreed to pay Trevithick \u00a31000 (the equivalent of \u00a373,038 in 2016[24]) if he could successfully complete the tunnel, a length of 1,220 feet (370\u00a0m). In August 1807, he began driving a small pilot tunnel or driftway 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) high tapering from 2\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (0.76\u00a0m) at the top to 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) at the bottom. By 23 December, after it had progressed 950 feet (290\u00a0m), progress was delayed after a sudden inrush of water; and only one month later on 26 January 1808, at 1,040 feet (320\u00a0m), a more serious inrush occurred. The tunnel was flooded; Trevithick, being the last to leave, was nearly drowned. Clay was dumped on the river bed to seal the hole, and the tunnel was drained, but mining was now more difficult. Progress stalled, and a few of the directors attempted to discredit Trevithick, but the quality of his work was eventually upheld by two colliery engineers from the North of England. Despite suggesting various building techniques to complete the project, including a submerged cast iron tube, Trevithick's links with the company ceased and the project was never actually completed.", "The first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size[12] during a NATO SACLANT Undersea Research project using jointly the NATO RV Alliance, and the Turkish Navy survey ship \u00c3\u2021ubuklu.

The sea level was about 120 metres (390\u00a0ft) lower than today, and the bed of the North Sea was dry and acted as a land bridge, now known as Doggerland, to the Continent. It is generally thought that as sea levels gradually rose after the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age, Doggerland became submerged beneath the North Sea, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500 BC.[42]", "The new cable was laid by the ship Great Eastern captained by Sir James Anderson.[21] Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of 2,300 nautical miles (4,300\u00a0km) of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on July 15, 1865, Great Eastern left the Nore for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by Caroline. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1,062\u00a0miles (1968\u00a0km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.[22]", "The critical problem of submarine detection required RDF systems operating at higher frequencies than the existing sets. When the first cavity magnetron was delivered to the TRE, a demonstration breadboard was built and demonstrated to the Admiralty. In early November 1940, a team from Portsmouth under S. E. A. Landale was set up to develop a 10-cm surface-warning set for shipboard use. In December, an experimental apparatus tracked a surfaced submarine at 13 miles range. At Portsmouth, the team continued development, fitting antennas behind cylindrical parabolas (called \"cheese\" antennas) to generate a narrow beam that maintained contact as the ship rolled. Designated Type 271, the set was tested in March 1941, detecting the periscope of a submerged submarine at almost a mile. The set was deployed in August 1941, just 12 months after the first apparatus was demonstrated. On November 16, the first German submarine was sunk after being detected by a Type 271.", "Ideas for a cross-Channel fixed link appeared as early as 1802,[10][11] but British political and press pressure over the compromising of national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel.[12] An early attempt at building a Channel Tunnel was made in the late 19th century, on the English side \"in the hope of forcing the hand of the English Government\".[13] The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994. At \u00a35.5 billion (1985 prices),[14] it was at the time the most expensive construction project ever proposed. The cost finally came in at \u00a39 billion ($21 billion), well over its predicted budget.[15][16]", "Navy Lieutenant Matthew Maury to aid installation of the first trans-continent telegraph cables in 1858, and a few examples of deep marine creatures.[11]", "In 1802, Albert Mathieu-Favier, a French mining engineer, put forward a proposal to tunnel under the English Channel, with illumination from oil lamps, horse-drawn coaches, and an artificial island positioned mid-Channel for changing horses.[10] Mathieu-Favier's design envisaged a bored two-level tunnel with the top tunnel used for transport and the bottom one for groundwater flows.[24]", "When the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1858 by businessman Cyrus West Field, it operated for only three weeks; subsequent attempts in 1865 and 1866 were more successful.[1]  Although a telephone cable was discussed starting in the 1920s[citation needed], to be practical it needed a number of technological advances which did not arrive until the 1940s[citation needed]. Starting in 1927, transatlantic telephone service was radio-based.[2]", "Cooke and Wheatstone had their first commercial success with a system installed on the Great Western Railway over the 13 miles (21\u00c2\u00a0km) from Paddington station to West Drayton in 1838, the first commercial telegraph in the world.[27] This was a five-needle, six-wire[26] system. The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit. However, the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles.[28] As an interim measure, a two-needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires, which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes.[29] But when the line was extended to Slough in 1843, a one-needle, two-wire system was installed.[30]", "In 1891 the Columbia was dredged to enhance shipping. The channel between the ocean and Portland and Vancouver was deepened from 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m) to 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m).

According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus entered Jerusalem riding on the animal (Matthew 21:4-7, John 12:14-15). Jesus appeared to be aware of this connection (Matthew 21:1-3, John 12:16).", "Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the Bible, beginning in the first book and continuing through both Old and New Testaments, so they became part of Judeo-Christian tradition. They are portrayed as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender. In contrast, horses were represented only in the context of war, ridden by cavalry or pulling chariots. Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period. Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys\u00a0\u2014 for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made.[76] They are used as a measure of wealth in Genesis 30:43,[77] and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of Shechem (the modern Nablus) is named Hamor (\"donkey\" in Hebrew).[78]", "In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the New Testament Nativity narrative. Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem Peter Bell:A Tale, using the donkey as a Christian symbol. Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I. The melancholy Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.[88]", "According to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, and sang part of Psalm 118: 25\u201326 \u2013 ... Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord ....[2][4][5][6]", "Christian theologians believe that the symbolism is captured prophetically in the Old Testament: Zechariah 9:9 \"The Coming of Zion's King \u00e2\u20ac\u201c See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey\", which is quoted in the Gospels. It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the King of Israel to the anger of the Sanhedrin.", "That night, Joseph ordered his steward to load the brothers' donkeys with food and all their money. The money they brought was double what they had from the first trip. Deceptively, Joseph also ordered that his silver cup be put in Benjamin's sack. The following morning the brothers began their journey back to Canaan. Joseph ordered the steward to go after the brothers and question them about the \"missing\" silver cup. When the steward caught up with the brothers, he seized them and searched their sacks. The steward found the cup in Benjamin's sack just as he had planted it the night before. This caused a stir amongst the brothers. However, they agreed to be escorted back to Egypt. When the Vizier (Joseph) confronted them about the silver cup, he demanded that the one who possessed the cup in his bag become his slave. In response, Judah pleaded with the Vizier that Benjamin be allowed to return to his father, and he himself be kept in Benjamin's place as a slave. (Genesis 44)", "Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the Bible and Ancient Greece. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys were found in the works of Homer, Aesop and Apuleius, where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the lower class. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's The Ass in the Lion's Skin, representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's The Golden Ass (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow. Shakespeare popularized the use of the word \"ass\" as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1600). In contrast, a few years later, Cervantes' Don Quixote shows a more positive slant on the donkey, primarily as Sancho Panza's mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.[88]", "Donkeys are also referred to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the Hindu and Islamic religions. Muhammad, the prophet of Islam said that dogs and donkeys, if they pass in front of men in prayer, will void or nullify that prayer.[83] He also said that \"when you hear the braying of donkeys, seek Refuge with Allah from Satan for (their braying indicates) that they have seen a devil.\"[84] In Hinduism, the goddess Kalaratri's vahana (vehicle) is a donkey.[85] Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the Hitopadesha[86] and the Panchatantra.[87]", "The symbolism of the donkey may refer to the Eastern tradition that it is an animal of peace, versus the horse, which is the animal of war.[1] A king would have ridden a horse when he was bent on war and ridden a donkey to symbolize his arrival in peace. Jesus' entry to Jerusalem would have thus symbolized his entry as the Prince of Peace, not as a war-waging king.[1][2] Thus there has been two different meanings (or more level of biblical hermeneutics): an historical meaning, truly happened according to the Gospels, and a secondary meaning which is the symbolism.", "In the third year of Darius, Daniel has a series of visions. In the first, four beasts come out of the sea, the last with ten horns, and an eleventh horn grows and achieves dominion over the Earth and the \"Ancient of Days\" (God) gives dominion to \"one like a son of man\". An angel interprets the vision. In the second, a ram with two horns is attacked by a goat with one horn; the one horn breaks and is replaced by four. A little horn arises and attacks the people of God and the temple, and Daniel is informed how long the little horn's dominion will endure. In the third, Daniel is troubled to read in holy scripture (the book is not named but appears to be Jeremiah) that Jerusalem would be desolate for 70 years. Daniel repents on behalf of the Jews and requests that Jerusalem and its people be restored. An angel refers to a period of 70 sevens (or weeks) of years. In the final vision, Daniel sees a period of history culminating in a struggle between the \"king of the north\" and the \"king of the south\" in which God's people suffer terribly; an angel explains that in the end the righteous will be vindicated and God's kingdom will be established on Earth.", "Mathon relates the story of a farmer who could understand what animals could say. One evening as the farmer passed by outside the stable, the farmer's ox complained to the farmer's donkey about how much more work the ox had to do in plowing the field instead of just carrying the farmer around. The donkey laughed and told the ox to try to claim a sick day. The next morning, when the ox proclaimed that he was sick and couldn't work, the farmer ordered that the donkey be used to plow the field. At the end of the day, the ox thanked the donkey for giving him a day of rest and the donkey proclaimed that he was \"like many another simplehearted one who starts to help a friend and ends up by doing his task for him. Hereafter you draw your own plow, for I did hear the master tell the slave to send for the butcher were you sick again. I wish he would, for you are a lazy fellow.\" This ended the friendship between the donkey and the ox.", "In the Jewish religion, the donkey is not a kosher animal. In the Zohar, it is considered avi avot hatuma or the ultimate impure animal, and doubly \"impure\", as it is both non-ruminant and non-cloven hoofed. However, it is the only impure animal that falls under the mitzvah (commandment) of firstborn (\"bechor\") consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals (See Petter Chamor). In Jewish Oral Tradition (Talmud Bavli), the son of David was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the tribes of Israel are undeserving of redemption.[79]", "Zechariah prophesied, \"Behold! Your King comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey\".[Src 6][41] His place in the chapel is directly above the door through which the Pope is carried in procession on Palm Sunday, the day on which Jesus fulfilled the prophecy by riding into Jerusalem on a donkey and being proclaimed King.[42]", "Donkey's years\u00c2", "donkey's years\u00c2", "Balaam sends back word that he can only do what YHWH commands, and God has, via a nocturnal dream, told him not to go. Balak consequently sends higher-ranking priests and offers Balaam honours; Balaam continues to press God, and God finally permits him to go but with instructions to say only what he commands. Balaam then sets out in the morning with the princes of Moab. God becomes angry that he went, and sends the Angel of the Lord (Numbers 22:22) to prevent him. At first, the angel is seen only by the donkey Balaam is riding, which tries to avoid the angel. After Balaam starts punishing the donkey for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the power to speak to Balaam (Numbers 22:28), and it complains about Balaam's treatment. At this point, Balaam is allowed to see the angel, who informs him that the donkey is the only reason the angel did not kill Balaam. Balaam immediately repents, but is told to go on.", "Donkey arrives at the swamp, where Shrek reveals that he overheard Donkey and Fiona's conversation.

The secularists in this analogy are \"The Donkey\" while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective \"Messiach\".

The desert proves arduous, and the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God provides manna and miraculous water for them. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses' father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints judges over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people.

Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and the king, although deeply distressed, must condemn Daniel to death, for the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, he has him cast into the pit. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and cries out anxiously, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that his God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, \"because I was found blameless before him.\" The king commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children, and writes to all the people of the whole world commanding that all should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.[3]", "Donkeys were featured in literature during the 20th century, including in George Orwell's 1951 Animal Farm, where Benjamin the donkey is portrayed as resilient and loyal.[88] Puzzle is a well-meaning but easily manipulated donkey in C.

Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3\u20138 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ... \"The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece.\" This identification is accepted by the church fathers ...[35]", "Many cultures have colloquialisms and proverbs that include donkeys or asses. British phrases include \"to talk the hind legs off a donkey\", used to describe someone talking excessively and generally persuasively.[92] Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as \"the donkey lets the rain soak him\".[93] The French philosopher Jean Buridan constructed the paradox called Buridan's ass, in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst because he could not find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision.[94] Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including \"put your money in the ass of a donkey and they'll call him sir\" (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and \"women, donkeys and goats all have heads\" (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats).[95] The United States developed its own expressions, including \"better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me\", \"a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey\", and \"a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold\", among others.[96] From Afghanistan, we find the Pashto proverb, \"Even if a donkey goes to Mecca, he is still a donkey.\" In Ethiopia, there are many Amharic proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, \"The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart\" (Bad company corrupts good morals).", "Joshua meets again with all the people at Shechem in chapter 24 and addresses them a second time. He recounts the history of God's formation of the Israelite nation, beginning with \"Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, [who] lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods\" (Joshua 24:2). He invited the Israelites to choose between serving the Lord who had delivered them from Egypt, or the gods which their ancestors had served on the other side of the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land they now lived. The people chose to serve the Lord, a decision which Joshua recorded in the Book of the Law of God. He then erected a memorial stone \"under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord\" in Shechem (Joshua 24:1-27). The oak is associated with the Oak of Moreh where Abram had set up camp during his travels in this area (Genesis 12:6).[citation needed] Thus \"Joshua made a covenant with the people\", literally \"cut a covenant\", a phrase common to the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages. It derives from the custom of sacrifice, in which the victims were cut in pieces and offered to the deity invoked in ratification of the engagement.[15]", "According to: \"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke\".Numbers 19:2", "Sarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of Mira, on a seal inscribed in both Hittite cuneiform and Luwian hieroglyphs.

The text says, \"This thing became a sin\", and its establishment was accompanied by several related violations of the covenant with God.[46] The language used by Jeroboam to introduce the worship of these idols to Israel was very similar to that used by Aaron with regard to the golden calf at Mount Sinai. The images themselves were reminiscent of Egyptian gods represented by the bull.[47] According to 1 Kings 13, God sends a prophet from Judah to denounce Jeroboam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions and predict the coming of King Josiah (290 years later), who would destroy those priests who participated in the idolatrous practices.[48]", "In 1:2, Malachi has the people of Israel question God's love for them.

The graveness of the situation is also indicated by the dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi proceeds to accuse his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way in which this disrespect is made manifest is through the substandard sacrifices which Malachi claims are being offered by the priests.

It was later sent to US urban contemporary radio on December 6, 2016, as the album's third single. The song features background vocals from Lana Del Rey.[2]", "\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" is a song by the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney.[3] It was released on the album Beatles for Sale in the United Kingdom in 1964. \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" was also released on the Beatles for Sale (No. 2) EP.[4] In the United States, Capitol released the song as the B-side of the single \"Eight Days a Week\", and later on the Beatles VI album, both in 1965. The single peaked at number 1 in the US[5] (it was not released in the UK);[6] \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" charted as a B-side, reaching number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100.[5]", "In March 1963 Phil Spector heard the demo of \"It's My Party\" while visiting Aaron Schroeder's office. Wally Gold would recall: \"He [Spector] said, 'Great, I love it. I\u2019m gonna do it with the Crystals.' We [the song's writers] were really excited, because that would ensure that the record was #1!\"[7] Schroeder apparently only learned of the Lesley Gore recording of \"It's My Party\" when Quincy Jones invited him to hear the completed track, which Schroeder found formulaic; believing that Spector would be able to cut a much stronger version of the song with the Crystals and not wanting to lose Spector's good will, Schroeder attempted to convince Jones to suppress the track. Schroeder didn't mention Spector's version to Jones but Jones and Spector both happened to attend a concert with Charles Aznavour at Carnegie Hall on the evening of 30 March 1963 and when they met outside it came up in conversation that Spector had recorded a version of \"It's My Party\" with the Crystals.[note 1] Jones skipped the concert instead spending that night\u2014a Saturday\u2014at Bell Sound Studios making a test pressing of the track comprising one hundred copies. Over the next two days Jones mailed these out to radio programmers in key markets across the US. Gore heard her record played on the radio for the first time that Friday; the official release of \"It's My Party\" came later in the month, with the disc ascending to #1 nationally in four weeks.[5][7] Jones was abroad at the time of \"It's My Party\"'s release. On his return he expressed dismay when Aaron Schroeder advised him that the rush release of \"It's My Party\" had precluded coining a more pleasant name for the singer than \"Lesley Gore,\" to which Schroeder replied: \"Didn't anybody tell you?...Quince, the record's number one. Do you really give a damn what her last name is?\"[5][not in citation given]", "Because of the pop cultural obsession with the song and its tragic nature, Gore recorded a sequel titled \"Judy's Turn to Cry\". In this song, the teenage girl narrator gets her revenge on Judy. In the lyrics the narrator explicitly finds \"foolish\" how much she cried when she saw Johnny and Judy together, and seems determined to start anew. But after she kisses another boy at another party, Johnny gets jealous, punches the other boy and returns to her.[2] Following just two months on the heels of \"It's My Party,\" the sequel reached number five on the charts.", "\"My Kinda Party\" is a song written and originally recorded by American country rock artist Brantley Gilbert from his 2009 album Modern Day Prodigal Son. Jason Aldean covered the song and his version serves as the lead-off single to his 2010 album of the same name.[1]", "However, Matthew Horton of BBC Online viewed \"Party\" as one of the \"less successful interruptions\" on 4.[17] Similarly, Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the song a mixed review, writing: \"[...] the less said about the phrase 'swag goo' the better; 'Party', the song on which those unfortunate words appear \u2014 Kanye West providing that unfortunate pun \u2014 is otherwise wonderful, but yet some errors are too grievous to forgive.\"[36] Andy Kellman from Allmusic stated, \"[...] What's most surprising is that a song titled 'Party' quickly settles into a low-watt groove and remains there.\"[37] Bill Lamb from About.com added, \"Kanye West and Andre 3000 provide interesting vocal color for 'Party' but the song itself is just a variant on the 'this is my night to be bad' theme.\"[38] A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that \"Party\" and \"Best Thing I Never Had\" were \"among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs\".[39]", "Sting recorded the tune for the original soundtrack of the film Party Party (1982).", "The song appears in the game Karaoke Revolution Party.", "Sean described the song as a \"real great party song.\"[3]", "\"It's My Party\" was credited to John Gluck, Wally Gold and Herb Weiner, staff writers at the Aaron Schroeder Music firm in 1962. The lyrics were actually written by Seymour Gottlieb, a freelance songwriter. He gave the lyrics to Herb Weiner, with whom he partnered in writing songs, to peddle. It was based on actual events relating to Gottlieb's daughter Judy's \u2018Sweet 16\u2019 party, before which she cried over the prospect of her grandparents being invited.[4] The demo for the song was cut by Barbara Jean English, a girl group veteran (the Clickettes, the Fashions), who was then working as a receptionist at the firm. She also worked with Jimmy Radcliffe, serving as the firm's in-house demo singer. Radcliffe produced the demo, and, according to English, \"tried to persuade Musicor [the label owned by Aaron Schroeder] to release it as a record, or to take me into a master studio and redo it, but they weren't interested.\"[5]", "\"Party\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00e9 for her fourth studio album, 4 (2011).

The song was written by Kanye West, Jeff Bhasker, Beyonc\u00e9, Dexter Mills, Douglas Davis and Ricky Walters and produced by Beyonc\u00e9 and West and co-produced by Bhasker.", "\"Take Care\" is a club song that samples Jamie xx's 2011 remix of Gil Scott-Heron's cover song \"I'll Take Care of You\", originally recorded by Bobby Bland in 1959.[2] The production of Drake's song was helmed by 40, reworking Jamie xx's remix.[3] Additionally, Drake makes reference to Lesley Gore's 1963 number one single, \"It's My Party\" by re-working the lyrics, \"It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to, can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to.\"[4] The song features guest vocals from Rihanna, marking the second collaboration of the pair, the first being Rihanna's number one single \"What's My Name?\" from her fifth studio album, Loud (2010), on which Drake was featured.[5][6] The song is written in the key of C minor. The vocal range in the song spans two octaves, from the lower note of C4 to the higher note of F5, between Drake, Rihanna, and the original sample of Scott-Heron.[7]", "Lesley Gore recalls that \"It's My Party\" was among some two hundred demos producer Quincy Jones brought to review with her in the den of her family home in February 1963. On hearing \"It's My Party,\" Gore told Jones: \"That's not half bad. I like it. Good melody. Let's put it on the maybe pile.\" The song proved to be the only demo Gore and Jones found agreeable. With Jones producing and Claus Ogerman handling arranging and conducting duties, Gore recorded 'It's My Party' at Bell Sound Studios in Manhattan on 30 March 1963.[5][6]", "Bell:\n\"Green Light\" by John Legend\n\"Party All the Time\" by Eddie Murphy", "In December 2007, it was re-released in a new remixed version as a digital download.

The song features music by Richard Wright and non-lexical vocals by Clare Torry.", "English folk singer Roy Harper provided lead vocals on the song. It was one of only two Pink Floyd recordings to feature guest lead vocals, the other being \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" with Clare Torry, though the latter piece featured no lyrics.", "An early incarnation of the song, titled \"The Mortality Sequence\" and lacking the vocals later contributed by Clare Torry, was performed by Pink Floyd throughout 1972. In its final version, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was performed live from 1973\u20131975, and from 1987\u20131994. During the band's 1974\u20131975 tour, David Gilmour played both pedal steel guitar and the Hammond organ, allowing Richard Wright to concentrate solely on piano (his keyboards were arranged where he couldn't play both). Gilmour's pedal steel for \"Great Gig\" was located accordingly beside Wright's Hammond. Starting in 1987, additional touring keyboardist Jon Carin took over the Hammond parts. Up to three singers performed the vocals, each taking different parts of the song. On the 1974\u201375 tour, vocal duties were handled by Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams, both former members of The Blackberries.[19]", "The song's lead vocals are performed by Roy Harper. Both Waters and David Gilmour had each attempted to sing the song on separate takes, as well as on a duet version (available on the 2011 Experience and Immersion editions of Wish You Were Here), but they were unhappy with the results. Harper was recording his album HQ in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3, and Roy Harper offered to sing the part as Gilmour has already provided some guitar licks for Roy (\"...for a price\").[7] The song is one of only two songs by the band which is not sung by one of their permanent members, the other being \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".", "By the end of the 1960s, Clare Torry managed to start a career as a performer, mainly based on covers of popular songs.[2] Alan Parsons asked her to take part in Pink Floyd's recording of the album The Dark Side of the Moon, on the instrumental song penned by Richard Wright going under the name of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". On 4 November 1973, Clare also sang \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at the Rainbow Theatre in London. [2][3][4][5]", "Great Gig in the Sky? It was just me playing in the studio, playing some chords, and probably Dave or Roger saying \"Hmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that sounds nice. Maybe we could use that for this part of the album.\" And then, me going away and trying to develop it. So then I wrote the music for that, and then there was a middle bit, with Clare Torry singing, that fantastic voice. We wanted something for that bit, and she came in and sang on it.[8]", "The album's credits include Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road.  She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".  She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday.  The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do.  Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band \u2013 only to find them delighted with her performance.[41][42]  Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track.[4]  For her contribution she was paid \u00a330, equivalent to about \u00a3360 in 2018,[41][43] but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship.  The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[44][45]  All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.[46]", "On the Delicate Sound of Thunder video, the vocals are shared by Rachel Fury, Durga McBroom and Margret Taylor. Clare Torry returned for the Knebworth '90 concert. The 1994 live album P\u2022U\u2022L\u2022S\u2022E features a version sung by Sam Brown, Durga McBroom and Claudia Fontaine. When the Floyd's manager, Steve O'Rourke, died in 2003, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason played \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at O'Rourke's funeral.[20]", "It was something that Rick had already written. It's a great chord sequence. \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" and the piano part on \"Us and Them,\" in my view, are the best things that Rick did \u2013 they're both really beautiful. And Alan [Parsons] suggested Clare Torry. I've no idea whose idea it was to have someone wailing on it. Clare came into the studio one day, and we said, \"There's no lyrics. It's about dying \u2013 have a bit of a sing on that, girl.\" I think she only did one take. And we all said, \"Wow, that's that done. Here's your sixty quid.\"[9]", "Longtime manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at his funeral at Chichester Cathedral, contrary to reports in the media claiming they played \"Wish You Were Here\".", "Torry is also credited on the 1987 album En Dejlig Torsdag (A Lovely Thursday) by the Danish pop rock band TV-2, where she sings in fashion similar to that of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at the end of the tracks \"Stjernen I Mit Liv\" (\"The Star in my Life\") and \"I Baronessens Seng\" (\"In the Bed of the Baroness\").[6]", "On the Easy Star All-Stars' Dub Side of the Moon album, there are two different dub music versions of the track, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" (Track 4) and \"Great Dub in the Sky\" (Track 11).", "Clare H. Torry (born 29 November 1947) is a British singer best known for performing the wordless vocals on the song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" by the group Pink Floyd on their 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. She also covered the Dolly Parton single \"Love Is Like a Butterfly\" for the opening titles of the BBC TV series Butterflies, which ran for 4 series between 1978 and 1983.", "There is a version by Elton John, featuring on the 2009 album Spirit In The Sky: Rare Sessions 1969\u00e2\u20ac\u201c70.", "In 1991, The Kentucky Headhunters covered \"Spirit In the Sky\" on their album, Electric Barnyard.[31] The song was covered by DC Talk for Jesus: Music from & Inspired by the Epic Mini Series soundtrack and was released as a B side with LeAnn Rimes' song \"I Need You\".[32][33]", "Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known,[3] was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 \u2013 more than a year before its release \u2013 at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed.[14] Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \"bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\"[15] Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote \"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\"[12] Melody Maker was less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo.\"[16] The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually recorded; differences included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as \"On the Run\", and Bible readings replaced by Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".[14]", "In 2004, she sued Pink Floyd and EMI for songwriting royalties on the basis that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" constituted co-authorship with keyboardist Richard Wright. Originally, she was paid the standard flat fee of \u00c2\u00a330 for Sunday studio work. In 2005, an out-of-court settlement was reached in Torry's favour, although the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[7] All releases after 2005 carry an additional credit \"Vocal composition by Clare Torry\"[8] for the \"Great Gig in the Sky\" segment.", "\"Spirit in the Sky\" is a song written and originally recorded[4] by Norman Greenbaum and released in late 1969. The single became a gold record, selling two million copies from 1969 to 1970 and reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (April 18, 1970), where it lasted for 15 weeks in the Top 100. Billboard ranked the record the No. 22 song of 1970.[5] It also climbed to number one on the UK, Australian and Canadian charts in 1970. Rolling Stone ranked \"Spirit in the Sky\" No. 333 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was featured on the 1969 album of the same name. Cover versions by Doctor and the Medics and Gareth Gates have also made the number 1 spot in the UK.", "Eye in the Sky contains the Project's biggest hit, the title track with lead vocals by Eric Woolfson. The album itself was a major success, reaching the Top 10 (and sometimes the #1) in numerous countries.[4]", "The remaining three of the 33 tracks are instrumentals. \"Flying\" is performed by The Secret Machines, \"And I Love Her\" is heard briefly as part of the orchestral score, and \"A Day in the Life\" is performed on guitar by Jeff Beck in a version recorded for Sir George Martin's 1998 album In My Life.", "Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds", "Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds", "The cello is less common in popular music than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of The Avett Brothers. The more common use in pop and rock is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as the Beatles and Cher used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' \"Yesterday\", \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", and Cher's \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". \"Good Vibrations\" by the Beach Boys includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist Jack Bruce, who had originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in \"As You Said\" on Cream's Wheels of Fire studio album (1968). In the 1970s, the Electric Light Orchestra enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called \"Beatlesque\" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, Colosseum II, collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording Variations. Most notably, Pink Floyd included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental \"Atom Heart Mother\". Bass guitarist Mike Rutherford of Genesis was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their Foxtrot album.", "\"Spirit in the Sky\" served as the first single from Pop Idol runner-up Gareth Gates' second studio album, Go Your Own Way. The single was released on March 14, 2003, and was the official Comic Relief charity single for 2003. The song features guest vocals from The Kumars. The song peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Gates' fourth number one single.", "Upon its original release, the band performed the song on UK music show Top of the Pops. The performance on the show featured mimed instrumental backing, with Harley performing a live vocal.[33] On the show, Harley was suffering from jet-lag, and subsequently forgot the lyrics to the majority of the second and third verses.[11] According to the EMI producer of the single, Tony Clark, it was Marc Bolan who made the phone call to Top of the Pops, and had Harley in the BBC studio that same evening of the recording. The band also performed the song on the Russell Harty Show while it was at number one.[34]", "More than 50 performers have recorded versions of the song. Charting versions were recorded by The Outlaws, Vaughn Monroe (\"Riders in the Sky\" with orchestra and vocal quartet), which topped the Billboard magazine charts, by Bing Crosby (with the Ken Darby Singers), Frankie Laine, Burl Ives (two different versions), Marty Robbins, The Ramrods and Johnny Cash. Other recordings were made by Eddy Arnold, Peggy Lee (with the Jud Conlon Singers), Christopher Lee, and Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Gene Autry sang it in the 1949 movie, Riders in the Sky. Jones himself recorded it for his 1957 album Creakin' Leather.[5] Children of Bodom, Impaled Nazarene and Die Apokalyptischen Reiter have also made covers.", "Elton John covered \"Spirit in the Sky\" in 1969.[28]", "Eye in the Sky is the sixth studio album by the British rock band The Alan Parsons Project, released in June 1982 by Arista label. It was recorded in London's Abbey Road Studios.", "Over the years, several versions of \"Boom Boom\" have been recorded by various Animals reunion lineups as well as by former members Eric Burdon and Alan Price. In 2012, the original 1964 version was used in the film Skyfall.", "After financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member, the band soon realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working, and decided to perform primarily their own material. (However, as appearances on French TV show, they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968: the Hayward-sung \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" and \"Bye Bye Bird,\" with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by Denny Laine now performed by Ray Thomas.) They were introduced to Decca staff producer Tony Clarke, who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" and Mike Pinder's older-styled \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (Decca F12607) as the 'Mark Two' Moodies' first single released in May 1967. These picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However, the sound gave clues about the direction in which their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder's mellotron, was introduced on Pinder's song \"Love And Beauty\" (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward's rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their \"new\" Moodies identity. Ray Thomas's flute had been in evidence earlier (\"I've Got a Dream\") on their debut album; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of everyman.", "The Roaring Silence also featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist Barbara Thompson, and Watch included two stand-out recordings from the band's live performances of \"Davy's on the Road Again\" and \"Mighty Quinn\". Taking advantage of the publicity of their hit song, the band re-released another Springsteen song, \"Spirit in the Night\", which the band had released the previous year on Nightingales & Bombers in a vocally re-cut version with Chris Thompson taking a new lead vocal in place of Mick Rogers vocal on the original album version. Following this popular success, the Earth Band released Watch which produced another hit single in \"Davy's on the Road Again\".", "In 2004, Torry sued Pink Floyd and EMI for songwriting royalties, on the basis that her contribution to \"Great Gig in the Sky\" constituted co-authorship with Richard Wright. Originally, she had been paid the standard Sunday flat studio rate of \u00a330 (equivalent to \u00a3400 in 2015[14]). In 2005, prior to a hearing in the High Court, an out-of-court settlement was reached. Although the terms of the settlement were not disclosed [15] all pressings after 2005 list the composition to Richard Wright and Clare Torry.[1]", "Penn added: \"The guitar player had the lick right\u2014we copied Wayne's demo. Then I asked the keyboard player to play an 'I'm a Believer' type of thing\".[6] Chilton sang the vocal live while the group was performing;[6] Penn noted: \"I coached him [Chilton] a little\u00a0... told him to say 'aer-o-plane,' told him to get a little gruff, and I didn't have to say anything else to him, he was hookin 'em, a natural singer.\"[7] He later explained, \"[Chilton] picked it up exactly as I had in mind, maybe even better. I hadn't even paid any attention to how good he sang because I was busy trying to put the band together\u00a0... I had a bunch of greenhorns who'd never cut a record, including me\".[8]", "On the album, \"Sirius\" segues into \"Eye in the Sky\". The former is usually followed by the latter on airplay, though not always in live performances \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at the World Liberty Concert \"Sirius\" was played as the introduction to \"Breakaway\" (from the Alan Parsons solo album Try Anything Once), with Candy Dulfer on saxophone.", "The song was covered by Riders in the Sky on the 2002 album Monsters, Inc.

The production team brought in the Stovall Sisters, an Oakland-based gospel trio, to sing backing vocals. Because of its unusual lyrics and style, the record company was initially reluctant to issue it, but was finally released as a single after two other singles from the album had poor sales. \"Spirit in the Sky\" became a worldwide hit, and was at the time the best-selling single ever for the Reprise label.[citation needed]", "In 1985, a new version of \"Just Like That\" (but which kept the original chorus) was recorded by Swedish duo Gemini, who performed the song live in the UK (with Benny playing the synthesizer) on Terry Wogan's chat show.[52] It was later released as a single.", "English singer Elaine Paige recorded the song for her 1983 album Stages.[13] Sarah Brightman, who was married to Webber from 1984 to 1990, included the song on her album The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection.[14] Marti Webb's version of the song was included in the 1995 album Music & Songs From Evita.[15] English musician Hank Marvin included an instrumental version of the song on his 1997 tribute album Hank Marvin and the Shadows Play the Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.[16] Kimberley Walsh, from British girl group Girls Aloud, covered the song for her debut studio album Centre Stage (2013).[17] Singer Hayley Westenra included the song on her 2000 album Walking in the Air.[18] On the tribute show Andrew Lloyd Webber: 40 Musical Years, the song was performed by actress Samantha Barks.[19]", "In the November 1966 issue of Hit Week, Dutch interviewers Hans van Rij and Emie Havers presented their story, saying the Moody Blues had been in the process of recording their second album, Look Out,[15] with Cordell producing. The album was not to be and \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (released as a single c/w \"Fly Me High\" some months later) is the only song mentioned in the article but the authors say Laine had written all of the material, with Thomas, Pinder and Clark (still the bass player) singing lead vocals as well.", "Riders in the Sky recorded a version of this song for the 2000 album Woody's Roundup: A Rootin' Tootin' Collection of Woody's Favorite Songs. The album is inspired by the fictional TV show Woody's Roundup featured in Toy Story 2.[28]", "In 1969, Bonham appeared on The Family Dogg's A Way of Life, with Page and Jones. Bonham also played for Screaming Lord Sutch on Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends in 1970. He played on Lulu's 1971 single \"Everybody Clap,\" written by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. In 1972, he played on a Maurice Gibb-produced album by Jimmy Stevens called Don't Freak Me Out in the UK and Paid My Dues in the US, credited as \"Gemini\" (his star sign). He drummed for his Birmingham friend, Roy Wood, on \"Keep Your Hands on the Wheel\", a single subsequently released on his 1979 album, On the Road Again, and on Wings' album Back to the Egg on the tracks \"Rockestra Theme\" and \"So Glad to See You Here\". He was also featured on Paul McCartney & Wings \"Beware My Love\" demo version first recorded in 1976, it remained unreleased until 2014 with the release of the album Wings at the Speed of Sound boxset.

Critical reception was unfavourable, and McCartney expressed disappointment with the album.[111][nb 19] Back to the Egg (1979) featured McCartney's collaboration with a rock supergroup dubbed \"the Rockestra\". Credited to Wings, the band included Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, Gary Brooker, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. Though certified platinum, critics panned the album.[113] Wings completed their final concert tour in 1979, with twenty shows in the UK that included the live debut of the Beatles songs \"Got to Get You into My Life\", \"The Fool on the Hill\" and \"Let it Be\".[114]", "\"Spirit in the Sky\" contains lyrics about the afterlife, making several references to Jesus, although Greenbaum is Jewish. (In a VH1 episode about famous one-hit wonders, Alice Cooper said that he was surprised to hear someone with a Jewish-sounding last name performing a song that seemed to be about Jesus.) Greenbaum recorded his first solo album with Jacobsen for Reprise Records. The song's arrangement came together in the studio in San Francisco where lead guitarist Russell DaShiell, bass player Doug Killmer from the band Crowfoot and drummer Norman Mayell worked with Greenbaum.

On October 25, 1791, Washington appealed a third time to Congress, \"A uniformity of the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the public council than conducive to the public convenience\", but it was not until 1838, that a uniform set of standards was worked out.", "It is often agreed[citation needed] that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability.

Hutton's work was later refined by scientist John Playfair and popularised by geologist Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology in 1830.[9] Today, Earth's history is considered to have been a slow, gradual process, punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events.", "Justifying the State's use of force to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of natural law. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of morality or constructs them. Thomas Aquinas wrote in the 13th century: \"the rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts\" (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I). He regarded people as by nature rational beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable.

Partly it would be by way of natural development and progress (the view espoused by David Hume) but more so by way of education (precursors of this view included John Locke, David Hartley, and the leaders of the Polish Enlightenment) and by way of overt state action (Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius, later Jeremy Bentham); reliance was placed in cooperation among people (Charles Fourier, 1808), later in eugenics (Francis Galton, 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the Enlightenment with the idealists and romantics \u2014 with Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the Polish Messianists \u2014 as well as with the 19th-century Positivists and evolutionists; Herbert Spencer penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.[19]", "Talleyrand, Assembl\u00e9e representative of the clergy, revolutionary leader and former Bishop of Autun, at the prompting of the mathematician and secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie Condorcet,[30] approached the British and the Americans in early 1790 with proposals of a joint effort to define a common standard of length based on the length of a pendulum. Great Britain, represented by John Riggs Miller and the United States represented by Thomas Jefferson agreed in principle to the proposal, but the choice of latitude for the pendulum proved to be a sticking point: Jefferson opting for 38\u00b0N, Talleyrand for 45\u00b0N and Riggs-Miller for London's latitude.[10]:93\u201395 On 8 May 1790 Talleyrand's proposal in the Assembl\u00e9e that the new measure be defined at 45\u00b0N \"or whatever latitude might be preferred\"[31] won the support of all parties concerned.[22] On 13 July 1790, Jefferson presented a document Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States to the U.S. Congress in which he advocated a decimal system in which units that used traditional names such as inches, feet, roods were related to each by the powers of ten. Again he proposed a system of weights based around the weight of a cubic unit of water and a \"rod pendulum\" rather than a \"bob pendulum\".[32] Riggs-Miller promoted Talleyrand's proposal in the British House of Commons.", "Until the early 19th century, the prevailing view in Western societies was that differences between individuals of a species were uninteresting departures from their Platonic ideals (or typus) of created kinds. However, the theory of uniformitarianism in geology promoted the idea that simple, weak forces could act continuously over long periods of time to produce radical changes in the Earth's landscape. The success of this theory raised awareness of the vast scale of geological time and made plausible the idea that tiny, virtually imperceptible changes in successive generations could produce consequences on the scale of differences between species.[13]", "Consultation paper No. 24 on the principle of proportionality", "Uniformity in the local laws and institutions of the different States is neither possible or desirable.

On his part, Emmerich de Vattel argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th century natural law and suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other. During the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or eclectic school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, territorial sovereignty, and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.", "A foundational idea within the study Earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism.

The desire for regional homogeneity was the driving force behind the French colonial doctrine of Assimilation.[26] The French style of colonialism stemmed from the idea that the French Republic was a symbol of universal equality.[27] As part of a civilizing mission, the European principles of equality were translated into legislation abroad. For the French colonies, this mean the enforcement of the French penal code, the right to send a representative to parliament, and imposition of tariff laws as a form of economic assimilation. Requiring natives to assimilate in these and other ways, created an ubiquitous, European-style identity that made no attempt to protect native identities.[28] Indigenous people living in colonized societies were obliged to obey European laws and customs or be deemed \u201cuncivilized\u201d and denied access to any European rights.[citation needed]", "Hugo Grotius, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse\u2014as Aristotle had indicated\u2014and reason.[34] Immanuel Kant believed a moral imperative requires laws \"be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature\".[35] Jeremy Bentham and his student Austin, following David Hume, believed that this conflated the \"is\" and what \"ought to be\" problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's positivism; that real law is entirely separate from \"morality\".[36] Kant was also criticised by Friedrich Nietzsche, who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the will to power, and cannot be labelled as \"moral\" or \"immoral\".[37][38][39]", "Part 1, Principles", "A contemporary of Confucius,[193] the logician Deng Xi (died 501 BC) was cited by Liu Xiang for the origin of the principle of Xing-Ming. Serving as a minor official in the state of Zheng, he is reported to have drawn up a code of penal laws. Associated with litigation, he is said to have argued for the permissibility of contradictory propositions, likely engaging in hair-splitting debates on the interpretation of laws, legal principles and definitions.[194] Shen Buhai solves this through Wu wei, or not getting involved, making an official's words his own responsibility.[195] Shen Buhai says, \"The ruler controls the policy, the ministers manage affairs. To speak ten times and ten times be right, to act a hundred times and a hundred times succeed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is the business of one who serves another as minister; it is the not the way to rule.\"[168] The correlation between Wu-wei and Xing-Ming likely informed the Taoist conception of the formless Tao that \"gives rise to the ten thousand things.\"[196]", "Uniformity is desirable but not essential on items in the concurrent list.[2] If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of such State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.

Alcuin led this effort and was responsible for the writing of textbooks, creation of word lists, and establishing the trivium and quadrivium as the basis for education.[14]", "The uniform law movement began in the latter half of the 19th century. The Alabama State Bar Association recognized as early as 1881 that wide variations in law between separate states often created confusion. In 1889, the New York Bar Association appointed a special committee on uniformity of laws. In 1890 the New York Legislature authorized the then-Governor of New York, Roswell Flower, to appoint three commissioners \"to examine certain subjects of national importance that seemed to show conflict among the laws of the several commonwealths, to ascertain the best means to effect an assimilation or uniformity in the laws of the states and territories, and especially whether it would be advisable for the State of New York to invite the other states of the Union to send representatives to a convention to draft uniform laws to be submitted for approval and adoption by the several states.\" The American Bar Association held its 12th Annual Meeting the same year and adopted a resolution recommending each state provide for commissioners to confer with the commissioners of other states on the uniformity of legislation on certain subjects.", "The Athenian conception was that \"laws that should govern everybody,\" in the sense of equality under the law or the Greek term isonomia.[9] Citizens had certain rights and duties: the rights included the chance to speak and vote in the common assembly,[2] to stand for public office, to serve as jurors, to be protected by the law, to own land, and to participate in public worship; duties included an obligation to obey the law, and to serve in the armed forces which could be \"costly\" in terms of buying or making expensive war equipment or in risking one's own life, according to Hosking.[9]", "In medieval Europe, it was universally accepted that the Pope ranked first among all rulers and was followed by the Holy Roman Emperor.[71] The Pope also had the sole right to determine the precedence of all others.[71][72] This principle was first challenged by a Protestant ruler, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and was later maintained by his country at the Congress of Westphalia.[71] Great Britain would later claim a break of the old principle for the Quadruple Alliance in 1718.[71][note 1] However, it was not until the 1815 Congress of Vienna, when it was decided (due to the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the weak position of France and other catholic states to assert themselves) and remains so to this day, that all sovereign states are treated as equals, whether monarchies or republics.[74] On occasions when multiple heads of state or their representatives meet, precedence is by the host usually determined in alphabetical order (in whatever language the host determines, although French has for much of the 19th and 20th centuries been the lingua franca of diplomacy) or by date of accession.[74] Contemporary international law on precedence, built upon the universally admitted principles since 1815, derives from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (in particular, articles 13, 16.1 and Appendix iii).[75]", "It assumes that citizens have moral rights and duties with respect to one another, and political rights against the state as a whole. It insists that these moral and political rights be recognized in positive law, so that they may be enforced upon the demand of individual citizens through courts or other judicial institutions of the familiar type, so far as this is practicable. The rule of law on this conception is the ideal of rule by an accurate public conception of individual rights. It does not distinguish, as the rule book conception does, between the rule of law and substantive justice; on the contrary it requires, as part of the ideal of law, that the rules in the book capture and enforce moral rights.", "The respondent had established that the prohibition of corporal punishment was part and parcel of a national program to transform the education system and bring it into line with the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The creation of uniform norms and standards for all schools was crucial for educational development, as was a coherent and principled system of discipline. The state was also under a constitutional duty to take steps to help diminish the amount of public and private violence in society generally, and to protect all people, especially children, from maltreatment, abuse or degradation. Furthermore, in every matter concerning a child, the child's best interests were of paramount importance. This principle was not excluded in cases where the religious rights of the parent were involved.[18]", "Bureaucratization and specialization are the driving processes behind the Iron Law. They result in the rise of a group of professional administrators in a hierarchical organization, which in turn leads to the rationalization and routinization of authority and decision-making, a process described first and perhaps best by Max Weber, later by John Kenneth Galbraith, and to a lesser and more cynical extent by the Peter Principle.", "Frederick Winslow Taylor, the father of scientific management, introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment. In Principles of Scientific Management, (1911), Taylor said: \"And whenever a workman proposes an improvement, it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method, and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard. And whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old, it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment.\"", "Of permanent importance was the Napoleonic Code created by eminent jurists under Napoleon's supervision. Praised for its Gallic clarity, it spread rapidly throughout Europe and the world in general, and marked the end of feudalism and the liberation of serfs where it took effect.[98] The Code recognized the principles of civil liberty, equality before the law, and the secular character of the state. It discarded the old right of primogeniture (where only the eldest son inherited) and required that inheritances be divided equally among all the children. The court system was standardized; all judges were appointed by the national government in Paris.[99]", "The basic matters of principle that defined the struggle between the two factions, were concerning the nature of constitutional monarchy, the desirability of a Catholic king,[53][page\u00c2\u00a0needed] the extension of religious toleration to nonconformist Protestants, and other issues that had been put on the liberal agenda through the political concepts propounded by John Locke,[54] Algernon Sidney and others.[55]", "Taylor had very precise ideas about how to introduce his system (approach): 'It is only through enforced standardization of methods, enforced adoption of the best implements and working conditions, and enforced cooperation that this faster work can be assured. And the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and enforcing this cooperation rests with management alone.'[33]", "R.

The Constitution also suggests a uniform civil code for its citizens as a Directive Principle.[79] This has not been implemented until now as Directive Principles are Constitutionally unenforceable. The Supreme Court has further held that the enactment of a uniform civil code all at once may be counter-productive to the unity of the nation, and only a gradual progressive change should be brought about (Pannalal Bansilal v State of Andhra Pradesh, 1996).[80] In Maharishi Avadesh v Union of India (1994) the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus against the government to introduce a common civil code, and thus laid the responsibility of its introduction on the legislature.[81]", "Lyell saw himself as \"the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old dispensation of Moses.\"[20] The two terms, uniformitarianism and catastrophism, were both coined by William Whewell;[21] in 1866 R.

In various revised editions (12 in all, through 1872), Principles of Geology was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century, and did much to put geology on a modern footing.

The structure was influenced by the Code Napoleon, including a preamble and introductory general principles.[4]", "The Lex Loci Report of October 1840 emphasised the importance and necessity of uniformity in codification of Indian law, relating to crimes, evidences and contract but it recommended that personal laws of Hindus and Muslims should be kept outside such codification.[2] According to their understanding of religious divisions in India, the British separated this sphere which would be governed by religious scriptures and customs of the various communities (Hindus, Muslims, Christians and later Parsis).[3] These laws were applied by the local courts or panchayats when dealing with regular cases involving civil disputes between people of the same religion; the State would only intervene in exceptional cases. Thus, the British let the Indian public have the benefit of self-government in their own domestic matters with the Queen's 1859 Proclamation promising absolute non-interference in religious matters.[4][5] The personal laws involved inheritance, succession, marriage and religious ceremonies. The public sphere was governed by the British and Anglo-Indian law in terms of crime, land relations, laws of contract and evidence\u2014all this applied equally to every citizen irrespective of religion.[5]", "Democritus\u2014the original atomist\u2014argued that all things in the universe, including light, are composed of indivisible sub-components (light being some form of solar atom).[8] At the beginning of the 11th Century, the Arabic scientist Alhazen wrote the first comprehensive treatise on optics; describing refraction, reflection, and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye. He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, Ren\u00e9 Descartes popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his treatise on light, showing that the behavior of light could be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium (\"plenum\"). Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades, Isaac Newton developed and championed his corpuscular hypothesis, arguing that the perfectly straight lines of reflection demonstrated light's particle nature; only particles could travel in such straight lines. He explained refraction by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens\u2014and later Augustin-Jean Fresnel\u2014mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media (such as water and air), refraction could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation of light waves. The resulting Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle was extremely successful at reproducing light's behavior and was subsequently supported by Thomas Young's 1801 discovery of double-slit interference.[9][10] The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not.[11]", "Federalist No. 80 asserts that the final authority to interpret the Constitution and federal law lies in the federal courts, not the states, because of the need for uniformity.[26] Likewise, Federalist No. 22 says that the federal courts should interpret federal law due to the need for uniformity.[27]", "A number of important principles spring from the basic idea of the rule of law.

According to D. N. Jha, cattle including cows were neither inviolable nor revered in the ancient times as they were later.[2] A Gryhasutra recommends that beef be eaten by the mourners, after a funeral ceremony as a ritual rite of passage.[3] In contrast, according to Marvin Harris, the Vedic literature is contradictory, with some suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption, while others suggesting a taboo on meat eating.[4]", "The fort and the city of Chittorgarh host the biggest Rajput festival called the \"Jauhar Mela\".[4] It takes place annually on the anniversary of one of the jauhars, but no specific name has been given to it.

The Shudra status is explained by the nomadic nature of herdsmen, which constrained the ability of other groups in the varna system to validate the adherence to practices of ritual purity; by their involvement in castration of the animals, which was considered to be a ritually polluting act; and because the sale of milk, as opposed to personal use thereof, was thought to represent economic gain from a sacrosanct product.[20]", "East India: Chakradharpur(Jharkhand)", "The morning of the third day is Gai Tihar (worship of the cow).

Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon found that even single cells were far more complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, and by the end of the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes.

No other cells can pass on inherited characters.[29] The work of Katherine Esau (1898\u20131997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for more than half a century.[30][31]", "Close to the nucleus of animal cells are structures called centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a loose collection of proteins. The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell's microtubules. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division, which is duplicated by the cell before a new round of mitosis begins, giving a pair of centrosomes. The two centrosomes polymerize tubulin to help form a microtubule spindle apparatus. Motor proteins then push the centrosomes along these microtubules to opposite sides of the cell. Although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly, they are not essential for the formation of the spindle apparatus, since they are absent from plants,[17] and are not absolutely required for animal cell mitosis.[23]", "Heredity is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring, either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction; the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents. Through heredity, variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by natural selection. The study of heredity in biology is called genetics, which includes the field of epigenetics.", "The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.", "Similar results are observed in mosquitos of the genus Culex, but the differences are seen between reciprocal crosses, from which it is concluded that the same effect occurs in the interaction between the genes of the cell nucleus (inherited from both parents) as occurs in the genes of the cytoplasmic organelles which are inherited solely from the female progenitor through the cytoplasm of the ovule.[3]", "It states simply that chromosomes, which are seen in all dividing cells and pass from one generation to the next, are the basis for all genetic inheritance. Over a period of time random mutation creates changes in the DNA sequence of a gene.

In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century it was found that the number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date.[98] With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.", "The Weismann barrier, proposed by August Weismann in 1892, distinguishes between the \"immortal\" germ cell lineages (the germ plasm) which produce gametes and the \"disposable\" somatic cells. Hereditary information moves only from germline cells to somatic cells (that is, somatic mutations are not inherited). This, before the discovery of the role or structure of DNA, does not predict the central dogma, but does anticipate its gene-centric view of life, albeit in non-molecular terms.[13]", "The two centrioles in the centrosome are tied to one another.

If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called diploid and the organism is called a diploid organism. (The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called haploid.) Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. For example, in humans, somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes organized into 23 pairs. By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a zygote. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).", "Before DNA replication, cells contain two centrioles. The older of the two centrioles is termed the mother centriole, the other the daughter. During the cell division cycle, a new centriole grows at the proximal end of both mother and daughter centrioles. After duplication, the two centriole pairs (freshly assembled centriole is now a daughter centriole in each pair) will remain attached to each other orthogonally until mitosis. At that point the mother and daughter centrioles separate dependently on an enzyme called separase.[18]", "After the rediscovery of Mendel's work, scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance. In 1911, Thomas Hunt Morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes, based on observations of a sex-linked white eye mutation in fruit flies.[19] In 1913, his student Alfred Sturtevant used the phenomenon of genetic linkage to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome.[20]", "The word centromere (/\u02c8s\u025bntr\u0259\u02ccm\u026a\u0259r/[30][31]) uses combining forms of centro- and -mere, yielding \"central part\", describing the centromere's location at the center of the chromosome.", "The following cell diagram describes the cell mentioned above:", "In a series of experiments beginning in the mid-1880s, Theodor Boveri gave the definitive demonstration that chromosomes are the vectors of heredity.

Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery at the start of the 1900s of Gregor Mendel's earlier work, Boveri was able to point out the connection between the rules of inheritance and the behaviour of the chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American cytologists: Edmund Beecher Wilson, Nettie Stevens, Walter Sutton and Theophilus Painter were all influenced by Boveri (Wilson, Stevens, and Painter actually worked with him).[14]", "Some cells divide asymmetrically by budding, for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast species used in baking and brewing.

The head contains the nucleus with densely coiled chromatin fibres, surrounded anteriorly by an acrosome, which contains enzymes used for penetrating the female egg. The neck contains the sperm centriole.

A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.", "This type of specification results from cell-intrinsic properties; it gives rise to mosaic development. The cell-intrinsic properties arise from a cleavage of a cell with asymmetrically expressed maternal cytoplasmic determinants (proteins, small regulatory RNAs and mRNA). Thus, the fate of the cell depends on factors secreted into its cytoplasm during cleavage. Autonomous specification was demonstrated in 1887 by a French medical student, Laurent Chabry, working on tunicate embryos.[10][11] This asymmetric cell division usually occurs early in embryogenesis.", "Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA condensation, to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.[107] The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.", "Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cell division either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two \"nuclear division\" processes. Binary fission is similar to eukaryote cell reproduction that involves mitosis. Both lead to the production of two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Meiosis is used for a special cell reproduction process of diploid organisms. It produces four special daughter cells (gametes) which have half the normal cellular amount of DNA. A male and a female gamete can then combine to produce a zygote, a cell which again has the normal amount of chromosomes.", "Sperm entry into the oocyte commences formation of an anterior-posterior axis. The sperm microtubule organizing center directs the movement of the sperm pronucleus to the future posterior pole of the embryo, while also inciting the movement of PAR proteins, a group of cytoplasmic determination factors, to their proper respective locations.[23] As a result of the difference in PAR protein distribution, the first cell division is highly asymmetric.[24] C. elegans embryogenesis is among the best understood examples of asymmetric cell division.[25]", "In 1906, the philosopher Eugenio Rignano wrote a book, Sur La Transmissibilit\u00e9 Des Caract\u00e8res Acquis, that argued for the inheritance of acquired characteristics.[39] He advanced a moderated Lamarckian hypothesis of inheritance known as \"centro-epigenesis.\"[40][41] However, his views were controversial and not accepted by the majority in the scientific community.[42]", "Mitosis is immediately followed by cytokinesis, which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle."]}, {"query": "what is the name of season 6 of american horror story", "similarities": [0.7593908905982971, 0.7579113245010376, 0.7579113245010376, 0.7545592188835144, 0.752554178237915, 0.7492576241493225, 0.7411572933197021, 0.735957682132721, 0.732401430606842, 0.7315949201583862, 0.7263239622116089, 0.7258455157279968, 0.7239975929260254, 0.7223460078239441, 0.7178778052330017, 0.7169116735458374, 0.7161211371421814, 0.7159417271614075, 0.7141433954238892, 0.7133449912071228, 0.7130153775215149, 0.7129056453704834, 0.7084993124008179, 0.7077237367630005, 0.7068595886230469, 0.7037732601165771, 0.7030772566795349, 0.7017545700073242, 0.70101398229599, 0.6999403238296509, 0.6992383599281311, 0.6987670063972473, 0.6978323459625244, 0.6973334550857544, 0.6971344351768494, 0.6965774297714233, 0.6965154409408569, 0.6962187886238098, 0.6957844495773315, 0.6955219507217407, 0.6949924826622009, 0.6934173703193665, 0.6927148699760437, 0.6925736665725708, 0.6925158500671387, 0.6920472383499146, 0.6906118392944336, 0.6904661059379578, 0.6903769969940186, 0.6903204917907715], "hits": ["The sixth season featured no title sequence or opening credits, instead opting for a simple title card (from the first season) which read \"American Horror Story\", while the series theme music plays over the end credits.

New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned.

Justice seems to have no love for Big and Little Enos, and doesn't hide it, as their hiring of the Bandit to do their runs in the past had led Buford into many humiliating predicaments while hunting the Bandit, and berates them (especially on Little Enos, attacking him for his small stature).", "Though the film Moonrunners (1975) is the precursor to the television series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979-1985), from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts, the popularity of Smokey and the Bandit and similar films helped get the Dukes series on the air. Three actors from the main cast of The Dukes of Hazzard appear in small uncredited roles in Smokey and the Bandit: Ben Jones, John Schneider and Sonny Shroyer (who played a police officer in both).

It was not until Needham's friend Burt Reynolds read the script, and said he would star, that the film was aimed at a more mainstream release; Reed would now portray Bandit's friend Snowman (Reed would eventually play the Bandit in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3). At that time Reynolds was the top box office star in the world. In the original script Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. Bandit's car was a second generation Ford Mustang and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000.[5]", "The film was originally entitled Smokey IS the Bandit, and did not include Jerry Reed in the cast.

According to some accounts, Jackie Gleason was to play two roles: Sheriff Buford T. Justice and a different \"Bandit\". The original version was shot in October 1982. Reportedly test audiences reacted poorly, finding Gleason's two roles confusing, so the studio opted to do reshoots in April 1983.[4] The Bandit scenes were re-shot with Jerry Reed playing the role. Other accounts indicate that the title was more literal: that Gleason was to play only Sheriff Justice, but the character would also fill the role of \"Bandit\", by taking the Enos family's challenge (as Reynolds' character had done in the previous films).[5] In a teaser trailer for the film (billed as Smokey Is the Bandit), Gleason appears in character as Justice, explaining to the audience that to defeat the Bandit he would adopt the attributes of his prey, \"becoming [my] own worst enemy\".

Gwynne's second appearance on The Phil Silvers Show (in the episode \"Its For The Birds\" in 1956 in which Bilko persuades bird expert Honnergar to go on The $64,000 Question) and many other shows led writer-producer Nat Hiken to cast him in the sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? as Patrolman Francis Muldoon, opposite Joe E.

In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism.", "B.F. Skinner (1904\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1990) is often referred to as the father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His book \"The Behavior of Organisms\",[5] published in 1938, initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of Ernst Mach, Skinner rejected Thorndike's reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.[6]", "The 20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against Edward Titchener's atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of behaviorism by John B. Watson, which was popularized by B.F. Skinner. Behaviorism proposed epistemologically limiting psychological study to overt behavior, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the \"mind\" was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve.", "The behavioristic approach to psychology reached its peak of popularity in the mid twentieth century but still underlies much experimental research and clinical application. Its founders include such figures as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B.F. Skinner. Pavlov's experimental study of the digestive system in dogs led to extensive experiments through which he established the basic principles of classical conditioning. Watson popularized the behaviorist approach to human behavior; his experiments with Little Albert are particularly well known. Skinner distinguished operant conditioning from classical conditioning and established the experimental analysis of behavior as a major component in the subsequent development of experimental psychology.", "Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus\u2013response pairings, now known as classical conditioning. They demonstrated that behaviors could be linked through repeated association with stimuli eliciting pain or pleasure. Ivan Pavlov\u2014known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previous linked with food\u2014became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans.[31] In the United States, Edward Lee Thorndike initiated \"connectionism\" studies by trapping animals in \"puzzle boxes\" and rewarding them for escaping. Thorndike wrote in 1911: \"There can be no moral warrant for studying man's nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts.\"[76] From 1910\u20131913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion, away from mentalism and towards \"behavioralism\", and in 1913 John B. Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought.[77] Watson's famous Little Albert experiment in 1920 demonstrated that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human.[12][78] Karl Lashley, a close collaborator with Watson, examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain.[67]", "John Broadus Watson (January 9, 1878 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c September 25, 1958) was an American psychologist who established the psychological school of behaviorism. Watson promoted a change in psychology through his address Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it, which was given at Columbia University in 1913.[3] Through his behaviorist approach, Watson conducted research on animal behavior, child rearing, and advertising. In addition, he conducted the controversial \"Little Albert\" experiment and the Kerplunk experiment. Watson popularized the use of the scientific theory with behaviorism.[4] He was also editor of Psychological Review from 1910 to 1915.[5] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Watson as the 17th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[6]", "As behaviorism grew out of Ivan Pavlov's work with the conditioned reflex, and laid the foundations for academic psychology in the United States associated with the names of John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, Abraham Maslow gave behaviorism the name \"the second force\". Historically \"the first force\" were psychologists like Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung, Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, Melanie Klein, Harry Stack Sullivan, and others.[10]", "Ivan Pavlov is another notable influence. He is well known for his classical conditioning experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.[24]", "Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is John B. Watson. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views,\" in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, \"Little Albert\", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.", "In the 1920s, behaviorism became the dominant paradigm, and remained so until the 1950s. Behaviorism used techniques based on theories of operant conditioning, classical conditioning and social learning theory. Major contributors included Joseph Wolpe, Hans Eysenck, and B.F. Skinner. Because behaviorism denied or ignored internal mental activity, this period represents a general slowing of advancement within the field of psychotherapy.[6]", "Behaviorism combines elements of philosophy, methodology, and psychological theory. It emerged in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to depth psychology and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. The earliest derivatives of Behaviorism can be traced back to the late 19th century where Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect, a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of reinforcement.", "The 20th century saw a reaction to Edward Titchener's critique of Wundt's empiricism. This contributed to the formulation of behaviorism by John B. Watson, which was popularized by B. F. Skinner. Behaviorism proposed emphasizing the study of overt behavior, because that could be quantified and easily measured. Early behaviorists considered study of the \"mind\" too vague for productive scientific study. However, Skinner and his colleagues did study thinking as a form of covert behavior to which they could apply the same principles as overt (publicly observable) behavior. The final decades of the 20th century saw the rise of cognitive science, an interdisciplinary approach to studying the human mind. Cognitive science again considers the \"mind\" as a subject for investigation, using the tools of evolutionary psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, behaviorism, and neurobiology. This form of investigation has proposed that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as artificial intelligence.", "After petitioning the President of the University of Chicago, Watson entered the university. His successful petition to the president of the University of Chicago was central to his ascent in to the psychology world. He began studying philosophy under John Dewey on the recommendation of Furman professor, Gordon Moore.[13] The combined influence of Dewey, James Rowland Angell, Henry Herbert Donaldson, and Jacques Loeb led Watson to develop a highly descriptive, objective approach to the analysis of behavior that he would later call \"behaviorism.\" [14]", "From the 1940s through the 1970s, behavioralism gained support. It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science.[5] The origins of behavioralism is often attributed to the work of University of Chicago professor Charles Merriam who in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized the importance of examining political behavior of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.[6]", "John B. Watson\u2019s behaviorism theory forms the foundation of the behavioral model of development 1925.[16] Watson was able to explain the aspects of human psychology through the process of classical conditioning. With this process, Watson believed that all individual differences in behavior were due to different learning experiences.[17] He wrote extensively on child development and conducted research (see Little Albert experiment). This experiment had shown that phobia could be created by classical conditioning. Watson was instrumental in the modification of William James\u2019 stream of consciousness approach to construct a stream of behavior theory.[18] Watson also helped bring a natural science perspective to child psychology by introducing objective research methods based on observable and measurable behavior.[citation needed] Following Watson\u2019s lead, B.F. Skinner further extended this model to cover operant conditioning and verbal behavior.[citation needed] Skinner used the operant chamber, or Skinner box, to observe the behavior of small organisms in a controlled situation and proved that organisms' behaviors are influenced by the environment. Furthermore, he used reinforcement and punishment to shape in desired behavior.", "Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within philosophy of language and analytic philosophy. It is sometimes argued that Ludwig Wittgenstein defended a behaviorist position (e.g., the beetle in a box argument)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut while there are important relations between his thought and behaviorism, the claim that he was a behaviorist is quite controversial. Mathematician Alan Turing is also sometimes considered a behaviorist,[citation needed] but he himself did not make this identification. In logical and empirical positivism (as held, e.g., by Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel), the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. W.V. Quine made use of a type of behaviorism, influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Gilbert Ryle defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book The Concept of Mind. Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented \"category mistakes\", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. Daniel Dennett likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist,[34] though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.[35]", "Prior to the founding of psychology as a scientific discipline, attention was studied in the field of philosophy. Due to this, many of the discoveries in the field of Attention were made by philosophers. Psychologist John Watson cites Juan Luis Vives as the Father of Modern Psychology due to his book De Anima et Vita (\"The Soul and Life\") in which Vives was the first to recognize the importance of empirical investigation.[3] In his work on memory, Vives found that the more closely one attends to stimuli, the better they will be retained.", "The term \"behaviorism\" was coined by John Watson (1878\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1959). Watson believed the behaviorist view is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science with a goal to predict and control behavior.[8][9] In an article in the Psychological Review, he stated that \"its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness\".[10] Behaviorism has since become one of three domains of behavior analysis, the other two being the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, and Applied Behavior Analysis.", "During the first half of the twentieth century, John B. Watson devised methodological behaviorism, which rejected introspective methods and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until the 1930s that B. F. Skinner suggested that private events\u2014including thoughts and feelings\u2014should be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called radical behaviorism.[1][2] While Watson and Ivan Pavlov investigated the stimulus-response procedures of classical conditioning, Skinner assessed the controlling nature of consequences and also its' potential effect on the antecedents (or discriminative stimuli) that strengthens behavior; the technique became known as operant conditioning.", "Leon Festinger is widely considered as the father of modern social psychology and as an important figure to that field of practice as Freud was to clinical psychology and Piaget was to developmental psychology.[14] He was considered to be one of the most significant social psychologists of the 20th century. His work demonstrated that it is possible to use the scientific method to investigate complex and significant social phenomena without reducing them to the mechanistic connections between stimulus and response that were the basis of behaviorism.[14] Festinger proposed the groundbreaking theory of cognitive dissonance that has become the foundation of  selective exposure theory today despite the fact that Festinger was considered as an \"avant-garde\" psychologist when he had first proposed it in 1957.[15] In an ironic twist, Festinger realized that he himself was a victim of the effects of selective exposure.  He was a heavy smoker his entire life and when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1989, he was said to have joked, \"Make sure that everyone knows that it wasn't lung cancer!\"[14] Cognitive dissonance theory explains that when a person either consciously or unconsciously realizes conflicting attitudes, thoughts, or beliefs, they experience mental discomfort. Because of this, an individual will avoid such conflicting information in the future since it produces this discomfort, and they will gravitate towards messages sympathetic to their own previously held conceptions.[16] Decision makers are unable to evaluate information quality independently on their own (Fischer, Jonas, Dieter & Kastenm\u00fcller, 2008).[17] When there is a conflict between pre-existing views and information encountered, individuals will experience an unpleasant and self-threatening state of aversive-arousal which will motivate them to reduce it through selective exposure. They will begin to prefer information that supports their original decision and neglect conflicting information. Individuals will then exhibit confirmatory information to defend their positions and reach the goal of dissonance reduction.[18] Cognitive dissonance theory insists that dissonance is a psychological state of tension that people are motivated to reduce (Festinger 1957). Dissonance causes feelings of unhappiness, discomfort, or distress. Festinger (1957, p.\u00a013) asserted the following: \"These two elements are in a dissonant relation if, considering these two alone, the obverse of one element would follow from the other.\" To reduce dissonance, people add consonant cognition or change evaluations for one or both conditions in order to make them more consistent mentally.[19]", "The modern roots of CBT can be traced to the development of behavior therapy in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner's studies of conditioning in 1920.[129] Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924[130] with Mary Cover Jones' work dedicated to the unlearning of fears in children.[131] These were the antecedents of the development of Joseph Wolpe's behavioral therapy in the 1950s.[129] It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on Ivan Pavlov's work on learning and conditioning, that influenced Hans Eysenck and Arnold Lazarus to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on classical conditioning.[129][132] One of Eysenck's colleagues, Glenn Wilson showed that classical fear conditioning in humans could be controlled by verbally induced cognitive expectations,[133] thus opening a field of research that supports the rationale of cognitive behaviorial therapy.", "Modern-day behavioural genetics began with Sir Francis Galton, a nineteenth-century intellectual and cousin of Charles Darwin.[3] Galton was a polymath who studied many things, including the heritability of human abilities and mental characteristics. One of Galton's investigations involved a large pedigree study of social and intellectual achievement in the English upper class. In 1869, 10 years after Darwin's Origin of the species, Galton published his results in Hereditary Genius.[5] In this work, Galton found that the rate of \"eminence\" was highest among close relatives of eminent individuals, and decreased as the degree of relationship to eminent individuals decreased. While Galton could not rule out the role of environmental influences on eminence, a fact which he acknowledged, the study served to initiate an important debate about the relative roles of genes and environment on behavioural characteristics. Through his work, Galton also \"introduced multivariate analysis and paved the way towards modern Bayesian statistics\" that are used throughout the sciences\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlaunching what has been dubbed the \"Statistical Enlightenment\".[6]", "Lorenz has been called 'The father of ethology', by Niko Tinbergen.[27] Perhaps Lorenz's most important contribution to ethology was his idea that behavior patterns can be studied as anatomical organs.[28]  This concept forms the foundation of ethological research.[27][29] However, Richard Dawkins called Lorenz a \"'good of the species' man\",[30] stating that the idea of group selection was \"so deeply ingrained\"[30] in Lorenz's thinking that he \"evidently did not realize that his statements contravened orthodox Darwinian theory.\"[30]", "John B. Watson in the 1920s and 1930s established the school of purist behaviorism that would become dominant over the following decades. Watson is often said to have been convinced of the complete dominance of cultural influence over anything that heredity might contribute, based on the following quote which is frequently repeated without context:", "In Watson\u2019s college experience, he met professors and colleagues that would assist him on his journey to becoming a well-known psychologist. These peers played an important role in his success in developing psychology into a credible field of study and his understanding of behaviorism. To Watson, behaviorism was a declaration of faith. It was based on the idea that a methodology could transform psychology into a science. He wanted to make psychology more scientifically acceptable. Later, Watson became interested in the work of Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936), and eventually included a highly simplified version of Pavlov's principles in his popular works.[15]", "Behaviorism involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes\u00e2\u20ac\u201deither environmental or reflexive. John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner developed this nurture-focused determinism.", "John Bowlby was originally a follower of the Freudian tradition at the Tavistock Clinic in London, but broke away from Freud's key ideas and revolutionised the field. Bowlby's inspiration came from reading the work of Konrad Lorenz, the famous Nobel Prize\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwinning founder of the field of ethology or animal behaviour. In particular Bowlby was struck by the phenomenon of imprinting, which Lorenz had studied in birds, and he saw the possibility that infants might imprint on their mother in a similar way. Along with his student Mary Ainsworth he studied infant behaviour, and developed what he called attachment theory. He rejected Freud's ideas of damage caused by frustrated impulses, in favour of the idea that maternal deprivation is a major cause of disturbed development and later psychological problems. Later he realised that infants need a stable, safe person or persons to provide a feeling of security from which they can venture out and explore. Many other workers in the field have since carried out experiments on infants and on animals which seem to confirm and refine this idea.[18]", "Descartes was the first of the modern rationalists and has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy.' Much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings,[33][34][35] which are studied closely to this day.", "The work of Thorndike, Pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist John B. Watson[11] set the direction of much research on animal behavior for more than half a century. During this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations; notably, around 1930 the differences between Thorndike's instrumental (or operant) conditioning and Pavlov's classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning were clarified, first by Miller and Kanorski, and then by B. F. Skinner.[12][13] Many experiments on conditioning followed; they generated some complex theories,[14] but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes. Probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the radical behaviorism of Skinner. This view seeks to explain behavior, including \"private events\" like mental images, solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal.[15]", "Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research. Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism. Positivism has also been espoused by 'technocrats' who believe in the inevitability of social progress through science and technology.[86]", "Radical behaviorism has generated numerous descendants. Examples of these include molar approaches associated with Richard Herrnstein and William Baum, Howard Rachlin's teleological behaviorism, William Timberlake's behavior systems approach, and John Staddon's theoretical behaviorism.", "This theoretical framework was developed in the early 20th century based on animal learning experiments by Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, Edward C. Tolman, Clark L. Hull, and B.F. Skinner. Many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning, but modern educators generally see behaviorism as one aspect of a holistic synthesis. Teaching in behaviorism has been linked to training, emphasizing the animal learning experiments. Since behaviorism consists of the view of teaching people how to do something with rewards and punishments, it is related to training people.[51]", "From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was behaviorism. Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was Jean Piaget. From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.[6]", "In the middle of the 20th century, behaviorism became a dominant paradigm within psychology, especially in the United States. This led to some neglect of mental phenomena within experimental psychology. In Europe this was less the case, as European psychology was influenced by psychologists such as Sir Frederic Bartlett, Kenneth Craik, W.E. Hick and Donald Broadbent, who focused on topics such as thinking, memory and attention. This laid the foundations for the subsequent development of cognitive psychology.", "Robert Ardrey in the 1960s argued for innate attributes of human nature, especially concerning territoriality, in the widely read African Genesis (1961) and The Territorial Imperative. Desmond Morris in The Naked Ape  (1967) expressed similar views.\nOrganised opposition to Montagu's kind of purist \"blank-slatism\" began to pick up in the 1970s, notably led by E. O. Wilson (On Human Nature 1979).\nTwin studies established that there was, in many cases, a significant heritable component. \nThese results did not in any way point to overwhelming contribution of heritable factors, with heritability typically ranging around 40% to 50%, so that the controversy may not be cast in terms of purist behaviorism vs. purist nativism. Rather, it was purist behaviorism which was gradually replaced by the now-predominant view that both kinds of factors usually contribute to a given trait, anecdotally phrased by Donald Hebb as an answer to the question  \"which, nature or nurture, contributes more to personality?\" by asking in response, \"Which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, its length or its width?\"[25] \nIn a comparable avenue of research,  anthropologist Donald Brown in the 1980s surveyed hundreds of anthropological studies from around the world and collected a set of cultural universals. He identified approximately 150 such features, coming to the conclusion there is indeed a \"universal human nature\", and that these features point to what that universal human nature is.[26]", "Behaviorism developed in the 1920s, and behavior modification as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and Hans Eysenck[46] in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States. Behavioral therapy approaches relied on principles of operant conditioning, classical conditioning and social learning theory to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for phobias, as well as other disorders.", "Radical behaviorism, or the conceptual analysis of behavior, was pioneered by B. F. Skinner and is his \"philosophy of the science of behavior.\"[1] It refers to the philosophy behind behavior analysis, and is to be distinguished from methodological behaviorism\u2014which has an intense emphasis on observable behaviors\u2014by its inclusion of thinking, feeling, and other private events in the analysis of human and animal psychology.[2] The research in behavior analysis is called the experimental analysis of behavior and the application of this field is called applied behavior analysis (ABA).", "Donald Olding Hebb FRS[1] (July 22, 1904 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c August 20, 1985) was a Canadian psychologist who was influential in the area of neuropsychology, where he sought to understand how the function of neurons contributed to psychological processes such as learning. He is best known for his theory of Hebbian learning, which he introduced in his classic 1949 work The Organization of Behavior.[3] He has been described as the father of neuropsychology and neural networks.[4] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Hebb as the 19th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[5] His views on learning described behavior and thought in terms of brain function, explaining cognitive processes in terms of connections between neuron assemblies.", "Behavior therapy relies on the principles of behaviorism, such as involving classical and operant conditioning. Behaviorism arose in the early 20th century due to the work of psychologists such as James Watson and B. F. Skinner. Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do is because of a stimulus and reinforcement. While this reinforcement is normally for good behavior, it can also occur for maladaptive behavior. In this therapeutic view, the patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced which will cause the maladaptive behavior to be repeated. The goal of the therapy is to reinforce less maladaptive behaviors so that with time these adaptive behaviors will become the primary ones in the patient.", "In the 1940s, B.F. Skinner delivered a series of lectures in Sunyani Fiapre, Ghana on verbal behavior, putting forth a more empirical approach to the subject than existed in psychology at the time.[4] In them, he proposed the use of stimulus-response theories to describe language use and development, and that all verbal behavior was underpinned by operant conditioning. He did however mention that some forms of speech derived from words and sounds that had previously been heard (echoic response), and that reinforcement from parents allowed these 'echoic responses' to be pared down to that of understandable speech. While he denied that there was any \"instinct or faculty of imitation\",[4] Skinner's behaviorist theories formed a basis for redevelopment into social learning theory.", "The first \"modern\" social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed almost simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology. Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857), known as the \"father of sociology\" and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science,[11] laid the groundwork for positivism \u2013 as well as structural functionalism and social evolutionism. In the 19th century three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the social evolutionism theory (of which Social Darwinism forms a part), the social cycle theory and the Marxist historical materialism theory.", "Edward Chace Tolman (April 14, 1886 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c November 19, 1959) was an American psychologist. Through Tolman's theories and works, he founded what is now a branch of psychology known as purposive behaviorism. Tolman also promoted the concept known as latent learning first coined by Blodgett (1929).[1] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Tolman as the 45th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[2]", "In the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the cognitive revolution.[56][57] This shift was due to methodological behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the cognitive therapy movement. In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:", "Embraced and extended by Clark L. Hull, Edwin Guthrie, and others, behaviorism became a widely used research paradigm.[26] A new method of \"instrumental\" or \"operant\" conditioning added the concepts of reinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior change. Radical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind, especially the unconscious mind, which they considered impossible to assess scientifically.[79] Operant conditioning was first described by Miller and Kanorski and popularized in the U.S. by B. F. Skinner, who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement.[80][81]", "Among the behaviorists who continued on, there were a number of disagreements about the best way to proceed. Neo-behaviorists such as Edward C. Tolman, Edwin Guthrie, Clark L. Hull, and B. F. Skinner debated issues such as (1) whether to reformulate the traditional psychological vocabulary in behavioral terms or discard it in favor of a wholly new scheme, (2) whether learning takes place all at once or gradually, (3) whether biological drives should be included in the new science in order to provide a \"motivation\" for behavior, and (4) to what degree any theoretical framework is required over and above the measured effects of reinforcement and punishment on learning. By the late 1950s, Skinner's formulation had become dominant, and it remains a part of the modern discipline under the rubric of Behavior Analysis. Its application (Applied Behavior Analysis) has become one of the most useful fields of psychology.", "Twentieth-century Chinese psychology originally modeled the United States, with translations from American authors like William James, the establishment of university psychology departments and journals, and the establishment of groups including the Chinese Association of Psychological Testing (1930) and the Chinese Psychological Society (1937). Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning, with the aspiration that education would enable modernization and nationalization. John Dewey, who lectured to Chinese audiences in 1918\u20131920, had a significant influence on this doctrine. Chancellor T'sai Yuan-p'ei introduced him at Peking University as a greater thinker than Confucius. Kuo Zing-yang who received a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, became President of Zhejiang University and popularized behaviorism.[53] After the Chinese Communist Party gained control of the country, the Stalinist USSR became the leading influence, with Marxism\u2013Leninism the leading social doctrine and Pavlovian conditioning the approved concept of behavior change. Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin's model of a \"reflective\" consciousness, envisioning an \"active consciousness\" (tzu-chueh neng-tung-li) able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle. They developed a concept of \"recognition\" (jen-shih) which referred the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview. (Failure to correspond with party doctrine was \"incorrect recognition\".)[54] Psychology education was centralized under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by the State Council. In 1951 the Academy created a Psychology Research Office, which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology. Most leading psychologists were educated in the United States, and the first concern of the Academy was re-education of these psychologists in the Soviet doctrines. Child psychology and pedagogy for nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline.[55]", "At around the same time, Clark Lewis Hull, an American psychologist, was a strong proponent of behaviorist stimulus-response theories,[5] and headed a group at Yale University's Institute of Human Relations. Under him, Neil Miller and John Dollard aimed to come up with a reinterpretation of psychoanalytic theory in terms of stimulus-response. This led to their book, Social Learning Theory, published in 1941, which posited that personality consisted of learned habits. They used Hull's drive theory, where a drive is a need that stimulates a behavioral response, crucially conceiving a drive of imitation, which was positively reinforced by social interaction and widespread as a result.[6]", "Ulric Gustav Neisser (December 8, 1928\u00a0\u2013 February 17, 2012) was a German-born American psychologist and member of the US National Academy of Sciences. He has been referred to as the \"father of cognitive psychology.\"[1] Neisser researched and wrote about perception and memory. He posited that a person's mental processes could be measured and subsequently analyzed.[2] In 1967, Neisser published Cognitive Psychology, which he later said was considered an attack on behaviorist psychological paradigms.[3] Cognitive Psychology brought Neisser instant fame and recognition in the field of psychology.[3] While Cognitive Psychology was considered unconventional, it was Neisser's Cognition and Reality that contained some of his most controversial ideas.[3] A main theme in Cognition and Reality is Neisser's advocacy for experiments on perception occurring in natural (\"ecologically valid\") settings.[3] Neisser postulated that memory is, largely, reconstructed and not a snap shot of the moment.[2] Neisser illustrated this during one of his highly publicized studies on people's memories of the Challenger explosion. In his later career, he summed up current research on human intelligence and edited the first major scholarly monograph on the Flynn effect. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Neisser as the 32nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[4]", "Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called \"the father of criminology.\"[4] He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the Italian school of criminology.[5] Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime.[6]  He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheek bones or hairline, or a cleft palate (the belief was this was a throwbacks to Neanderthals) could indicate \"atavistic\" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of phrenology and by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, has been superseded. Enrico Ferri, a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories, with control groups not used in his studies.[7][8]", "Molar behaviorists, such as Howard Rachlin, Richard Herrnstein, and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism's history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as \"associative strength\", are better replaced by molar variables such as rate of reinforcement.[39] Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe \"loving someone\" as a pattern of loving behavior over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as \"love\"."]}, {"query": "joined mexico and the united states to form nafta", "similarities": [0.8516203761100769, 0.8233197927474976, 0.8014224171638489, 0.7788882255554199, 0.77716064453125, 0.776401162147522, 0.7754451632499695, 0.7598774433135986, 0.747502326965332, 0.7463705539703369, 0.7445842623710632, 0.7424718737602234, 0.7397117018699646, 0.7389529347419739, 0.7383921146392822, 0.732865571975708, 0.7325344681739807, 0.7319576144218445, 0.73151695728302, 0.7312386631965637, 0.7309476733207703, 0.7305266261100769, 0.728739857673645, 0.7273030281066895, 0.7265886068344116, 0.7265087962150574, 0.7245076298713684, 0.7243857383728027, 0.7229644656181335, 0.7223482131958008, 0.7216694355010986, 0.7211409211158752, 0.7207924127578735, 0.7183518409729004, 0.7177839279174805, 0.7177475094795227, 0.7175471782684326, 0.7168633937835693, 0.7161744236946106, 0.7150312662124634, 0.7147074341773987, 0.7141250967979431, 0.7116895318031311, 0.7116342782974243, 0.7108855247497559, 0.7108373045921326, 0.7106984257698059, 0.7104498744010925, 0.710390031337738, 0.7080593109130859], "hits": ["On 1 January 1994, Mexico became a full member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), joining the United States and Canada.[101]", "Mexico, United States and Canada signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 with the goal of eliminating barriers to trade and investment.", "The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, created one of the largest trade blocs in the world in 1994.[citation needed]", "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; Spanish: Tratado de Libre Comercio de Am\u00e9rica del Norte, TLCAN; French: Accord de libre-\u00e9change nord-am\u00e9ricain, AL\u00c9NA) is an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America.

Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.[118] The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.[119] This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the United States is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010.[120] The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other's largest trade partners. The United States is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico;[121] while Canada and Mexico are each other's third largest trade partners.[122][123]", "These nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs.

In both countries, regional economic ties loomed larger than the historical trans-Atlantic ones. In 1988, Canada signed a free trade agreement with the United States, which became the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 with the addition of Mexico. Thus, the two nations are now in separate trade blocs, the European Union and North American Free Trade Agreement respectively.

In turn, Canada is the third largest foreign direct investor in Britain.", "North America: Canada, Mexico and United States.", "On the economic plane, hardly affected by the 1973 oil crisis, the refusal of Mexico in 1983 to pay the interest of its debt led to the Latin American debt crisis and subsequently to a shift from the Import substitution industrialization policies followed by most countries to export-oriented industrialization, which was encouraged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO). While globalization was making its effects felt in the whole world, the 1990s were dominated by the Washington Consensus, which imposed a series of neo-liberal economic reforms in Latin America. The First Summit of the Americas, held in Miami in 1994, resolved to establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas (ALCA, \u00c1rea de Libre Comercio de las Am\u00e9ricas) by 2005. The ALCA was supposed to be the generalization of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which came into force in 1994. Opposition to both NAFTA and ALCA was symbolized during this time by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation insurrection, headed by Subcomandante Marcos, which became active on the day that NAFTA went into force (1 January 1994) and declared itself to be in explicit opposition to the ideology of globalization or neoliberalism, which NAFTA symbolized.", "The Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement laid the groundwork for a multilateral and multicultural agreement between, the United States, Mexico, and Canada, called the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has helped to increase more trade among them.

In 2000, Vicente Fox became the first non-PRI candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years.

The implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994 brought the immediate elimination of tariffs on more than one-half of Mexico's exports to the U.S. and more than one-third of U.S. exports to Mexico. Within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement, all U.S.-Mexico tariffs were to be eliminated except for some U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico to be phased out within 15 years.[25] Most U.S.-Canada trade was already duty-free. NAFTA also sought to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property rights on traded products.", "Under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari Mexico campaigned to join the North American Free Trade Agreement with the expanded treaty going into effect in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada on January 1, 1994. Mexico implemented neoliberal economic policies and changed significant articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 to ensure private property rights against future nationalization. In the twenty-first century, Mexico has strengthened its trade ties with China, but Chinese investment projects in Mexico have hit roadblocks in 2014\u201315.

However, once the United States entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 with Mexico it became easier for Mexico to export its products to the United States. CBI countries had lost their advantage relative to Mexico, a major competitor in industries such as textiles and apparel, so they sought to increase their own preferences and achieve \"NAFTA parity\". Those efforts were not successful until the 2000 Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, which was broadened in 2002. Several exports from the region continue to receive preferential status in the United States, however those preferences will likely be replaced by bilateral free trade agreements, and possibly by the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.", "Later, amid a push for greater integration and concerns about the impact of heightened security on trade relations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, an effort was organized in 2003 by the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, and the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations called the Independent Task Force on North America.[24] Several weeks before a meeting of North American leaders on March 23, 2005 the Task Force issued a press release and a statement from the Task Force's chairmen calling for deeper integration of NAFTA to form a North American Economic and Security Community by 2010.[25]", "In May 2004 the United States of America signed the American Free trade Agreement with five Central American nations.[4]", "Mexico's imports and exports reflect its membership in NAFTA, with significant trade with the U.S. and Canada.

On the master board there are three locations: Bag End, Rivendell, and Lothl\u00f3rien. The game starts at Bag End and each player draws a card identifying the player's Hobbit character, each of which has a special ability. Each player is dealt cards that allow him to complete four different activities: traveling, hiding, friendship or fighting. One hobbit is initially assigned to be the \"ring bearer\", but a new hobbit may become the ring bearer after each scenario is completed. The journey through the game calls for jumping back and forth between the main board and the other four boards. Players advance through locations such as Rivendell, Lothl\u00f3rien, Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob\u2019s Lair, and Mordor; all while trying to stay away from the dark lord Sauron. Players are eliminated if they are on the same space as Sauron or are behind him.

Frodo finally succumbs to the Ring's power and claims it as his own, refusing to destroy it. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring, but Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano. Both Frodo and Sam then escape the volcano. The Ring and Sauron are both destroyed, causing a chain-reaction that consumes the mountain, topples Barad-d\u00fbr, and kills most of the fleeing Orcs as the ground crumbles beneath them. Gandalf flies in with eagles to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Rivendell and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen. The Hobbits then return to the Shire where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Frodo, unable to cope with the traumas of his journey, departs Middle Earth for the Undying Lands with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves.

Frodo is ostensibly moving to a newly purchased house, having sold his hobbit-hole to his relatives, the Sackville-Bagginses. However, he and Sam have secretly planned to journey beyond, to Bree where he will meet again with Gandalf, so that they can travel to Rivendell; Frodo has the Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron in his possession, and he believes it will be safe there. They journey into the night, and at this point", "The Grey Havens, an Elven port on the western shores, is attacked by the Corsairs of Umbar, allies of Sauron. The Dwarves, who have been reluctant to ally with the Elves, eventually decide to come to the aid of the Grey Havens. With the Goblins defeated and all of Eriador pacified, the Dwarven-Elven alliance is tested by Sauron's forces. Mordor's overwhelming forces besiege the Lake Town of Esgaroth and the Dwarven city of Erebor. The Dwarven king D\u00e1in leads a small group of Dwarves and men of Dale to defend their homeland and manage to eliminate the Mordor presence in Esgaroth but are forced to retreat back to Erebor to defend themselves against an overwhelming army led by the Mouth of Sauron. After a long battle against the Mouth of Sauron's army, Elven reinforcements from Mirkwood led by the Elven king Thranduil arrive and save the Dwarves, defeating the Mouth of Sauron and his army. Elrond leads the first attack, but later, Thranduil, Glorfindel, Gl\u00f3in, Arwen, and King D\u00e1in all unite under the Dwarven-Elven alliance for a final battle in Dol Guldur, the stronghold of Sauron in Mirkwood, aided by the Ents and Eagles.

Aragorn heals Faramir, using athelas or kingsfoil (the same weed he used to ease Frodo's pain at Weathertop and outside of Moria).  Aragorn also heals Merry and \u00c3\u2030owyn, who were hurt by the Witch-king before he fell, and he then turns his attention to the numerous wounded, fulfilling the prophecy in an old Gondorian wives' tale saying that \"The hands of the king are the hands of a healer.\" This earns him the love and admiration of the people of Minas Tirith, who name him \"Elfstone\" for his elven-brooch, which also fulfils the prophesied name of the legitimate king.

At first it seems that they are too late, but then the winds change and begin to dispel the darkness.  Revived, the Rohirrim charge into the enemy on the Pelennor.  Th\u00e9oden is mortally wounded when the Nazg\u00fbl cause his horse to go mad and fall on him and placing him at the mercy of the Witch-king.  In the following Battle of the Pelennor Fields the Witch-king is slain by Dernhelm, revealed to be \u00c9owyn the niece of King Th\u00e9oden, with help from Merry. The battle is also joined by a \"black fleet with black sails\". The forces of Mordor initially rejoice at its arrival; and then are horrified to see the banner of the King upon the ships. Aragorn has succeeded in using the Oathbreakers to defeat the Corsairs of Umbar; the men of Gondor who were once slaves on the ships are brought back to fight the host of Mordor.

The now sixty Elves dwell by the rivers, and they invent poetry and music in Middle-earth (the continent). Journeying further, they come across eighteen pairs of Elves watching the stars, whom Tata claims as his. These are  tall and dark-haired, the fathers of most of the Noldor. The ninety-six Elves now invented many new words. Continuing their journey, they find twenty-four pairs of Elves, singing without language, and Enel adds them to his people. These are the ancestors of most of the Lindar or \"singers\", later called Teleri.  They find no more Elves; Imin's people, the smallest group, are the ancestors of the Vanyar. All in all the Elves number 144. Because all Elves had been found in groups of twelve, twelve becomes their base number and 144 their highest number (for a long time), and none of the later Elvish languages have a common name for a greater number.[26]", "Thranduil and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by Thr\u00f3r.

When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo.

Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit.

Despite heavy resistance, the forest is overrun, with Celeborn slain and Galadriel having fled to Rivendell; even Caras Galadhon collapses under the sheer force of the massive invasion. The Mouth peers eagerly into the captured Mirror of Galadriel for his next attack, as his Goblins celebrate their triumph over the Elves amidst the ruins of the once-mighty ancient stronghold. Another group of Goblins, led by the Goblin King Gorkil, attacks the Grey Havens by land and sea. The Elven port is destroyed and captured, and the march across Eriador begins; Hobbits of the Shire are chosen as the next target. Gorkil's horde manages to crush the Hobbits and burn their country to the ground, but Saruman's servant Gr\u00edma Wormtongue, suddenly appears with a large army of Isengard Uruks and claims the land for his master.

The hobbits are given some of the nourishment of the Ents, Ent-draught, which causes them to grow. Treebeard then calls a council of the Ents, or an Entmoot. There, Treebeard and another Ent named Quickbeam persuades the Ent council to oppose the menace posed to the forest by the wizard Saruman, as suggested by Merry and Pippin, as Treebeard realizes that Saruman's minions have been cutting down large numbers of their trees to fuel the furnaces needed for Saruman's arming of his dark army.

Galadriel was thus not directly involved in the revolt of the Noldorin princes in this version, and indeed fought against them at Alqualond\u00eb during the kinslaying; but she fell under the Ban of the Valar because she left the Undying Lands without permission. In Beleriand she and Celeborn were welcomed by Thingol and lived in Doriath. When the Noldor arrived in Beleriand, Galadriel re-established contact with her brothers. In this version of the story, she is offered a pardon by the Valar, but refused it out of pride and therefore remained under the Ban. In even later accounts from Unfinished Tales, written not long before Tolkien died, Galadriel was not even subject to the Ban, and remained in Middle-earth of her own volition.", "As told in the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring, Glorfindel was sent by Elrond of Rivendell to help the hobbit Frodo reach Rivendell as he is pursued by the Nazg\u00fbl.

It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired pinch hitter Chuck Knoblauch (who batted for the left handed Paul O'Neill) on a fly out to Bautista in right field, then Johnson returned to the mound for the top of the ninth where he got Bernie Williams to fly out to Steve Finley in center field, Martinez to ground out to Tony Womack at shortstop and he then struck out catcher Jorge Posada to send the game to the bottom of the ninth inning.", "In 2016, the Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908, ending the historic 108-year drought and destroying the \"curse.\""]}, {"query": "when did hollywood become the centre of the film industry", "similarities": [0.7899724841117859, 0.7781810164451599, 0.7727089524269104, 0.7617464661598206, 0.7550548911094666, 0.7528180480003357, 0.7511473298072815, 0.7477753162384033, 0.7454397082328796, 0.7443231344223022, 0.7442405819892883, 0.7438814043998718, 0.7416685819625854, 0.7325478196144104, 0.7324692010879517, 0.7312207818031311, 0.7306362390518188, 0.7262973189353943, 0.7256267666816711, 0.7210621237754822, 0.7180350422859192, 0.7176777720451355, 0.7169017195701599, 0.716453492641449, 0.7162813544273376, 0.7162557244300842, 0.716111421585083, 0.7158403992652893, 0.7157989740371704, 0.7135528922080994, 0.7124531269073486, 0.7120824456214905, 0.7119794487953186, 0.7112351655960083, 0.7107605338096619, 0.7104113698005676, 0.7096695899963379, 0.7094268202781677, 0.7080265879631042, 0.7061384320259094, 0.7048545479774475, 0.7047984600067139, 0.704338788986206, 0.7040936350822449, 0.7036318778991699, 0.703510046005249, 0.7034362554550171, 0.7033315896987915, 0.703147292137146, 0.702800452709198], "hits": ["Hollywood has been synonymous worldwide with the film industry for over a hundred years. It was incorporated as the City of Hollywood in 1903 but merged into LA in 1910. In the 1900s Jewish movie makers from New York found the sunny, temperate weather more suitable for year-round location shooting. It boomed into the cinematic heart of the United States, and has been the home and workplace of actors, directors and singers that range from small and independent to world-famous, leading to the development of related television and music industries.[56]", "Hollywood was a small community in 1870 and was incorporated as a municipality in 1903.[4][5] It was consolidated with the city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged, eventually becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world.[6][7]", "D. W. Griffith had the highest standing among American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. The American film industry, or \"Hollywood\", as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in Hollywood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries. By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 feature films annually,[1] or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). During late 1927, Warner's released The Jazz Singer, with the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Sound saved the Hollywood studio system in the face of the Great Depression (Parkinson, 1995).", "At the start of the First World War, French and Italian cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries.

The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana by Charles Francis Jenkins. The first movie studio in the Hollywood area, Nestor Studios, was founded in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley in an old building on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.", "The British film industry emerged in the 1890s when cinemas in general broke through in the western world, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors and producers.[122] The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 percent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile\u2014the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets. Bollywood (based in Bombay) dominated the huge Indian market.[123] The most prominent directors remaining in London were Alexander Korda, an expatriate Hungarian, and Alfred Hitchcock. There was a revival of creativity in the 1933\u201345 era, especially with the arrival of Jewish filmmakers and actors fleeing the Nazis.[124][125] Meanwhile, giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.[126]", "In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A.[43] The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.[44] By 1930, the population surpassed one million.[45] In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.", "With the invention of the motion picture in the late 19th century by Thomas Edison and the growth of the motion picture industry in Hollywood in the early 20th century, film became a dominant performance medium throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.", "Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[621] The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.[622] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[623]", "Even as the Wall Street crash of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into depression, the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune. The 1929\u201330 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous, with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs. Reality finally struck later in 1930, but sound had clearly secured Hollywood's position as one of the most important industrial fields, both commercially and culturally, in the United States. In 1929, film box-office receipts comprised 16.6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation; by 1931, the figure had reached 21.8 percent. The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half.[135] Hollywood ruled on the larger stage, as well. The American movie industry\u2014already the world's most powerful\u2014set an export record in 1929 that, by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film, was 27 percent higher than the year before.[136] Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded. In fact, the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers, relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards. The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages (known as \"Foreign Language Version\"), as well as the production of the cheaper \"International Sound Version\", a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-dubbing and subtitling. Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets, by 1937, American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe.[137]", "Hollywood became known as Tinseltown[2] because of the glittering image of the movie industry. Hollywood has since become a major center for film study in the United States.", "The history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the East Coast where, at one time, Fort Lee, New Jersey was the motion-picture capital of America. The industry got its start at the end of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison's \"Black Maria\", the first motion-picture studio in West Orange, New Jersey. The cities and towns on the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades offered land at costs considerably less than New York City across the river and benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century.[13][14][15]", "By about 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened.

The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. Hollywood is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the American Film Institute, LA Film School and NYFA being established in the area.[8] However, four of the six major film studios are owned by East Coast companies. The major film studios of Hollywood including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Lightstorm Entertainment are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world, such as Gone with the Wind (1939), Star Wars (1977), and Titanic (1997).", "In the art of film making, the Golden Age of Hollywood entered a whole decade, after the advent of talking pictures (\"talkies\") in 1927 and full-color films in 1930: more than 50 classic films were made in the 1930s: most notable were Gone With The Wind and The Wizard of Oz.", "The cinema of the United States, often metonymously referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on the film industry in general since the early 20th century. The dominant style of American cinema is classical Hollywood cinema, which developed from 1917 to 1960 and characterizes most films made there to this day. While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema,[7] American cinema quickly came to be the most dominant force in the industry as it emerged. Since the 1920s, the film industry of the United States has had higher annual grosses than any other country's.[citation needed] It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema, with more than 800 English-language films released on average every year.[8] While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom (299), Canada (206), and Australia and New Zealand also produce films in the same language, they are not considered part of the Hollywood system. Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema.[9] Classical Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles, often in Spanish or French. Contemporary Hollywood offshores production to Canada, Australia,and New Zealand.", "Soon film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry.", "In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City, using Thomas Edison's kinetoscope.

Since the early 20th century, the US film industry has largely been based in and around the 30 Mile Zone in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Director D. W. Griffith was central to the development of a film grammar. Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited in critics' polls as the greatest film of all time.[12]", "From about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros., owned large, grand theaters throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the Golden Age of Hollywood.  In a landmark 1948 court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and movie stars, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.", "Credits began to appear at the beginning of motion pictures in 1911.", "The period stretching from the introduction of sound to the beginning of the demise of the studio system, 1927\u20131948/1949, is referred to by some film historians as the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Golden Age is a purely technical distinction and not to be confused with the style in film criticism known as Classical Hollywood cinema, a style of American film which developed from 1917 to 1963 and characterizes it to this day.\nDuring the so-called Golden Age, eight companies constituted the major studios that promulgated the Hollywood studio system. Of these eight, five were fully integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox), Loew\u2019s Incorporated (owner of America's largest theater circuit and parent company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), Paramount Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures, and Warner Bros. Two majors\u2014Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures\u2014were similarly organized, though they never owned more than small theater circuits. The eighth of the Golden Age majors, United Artists, owned a few theaters and had access to two production facilities owned by members of its controlling partnership group, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films.", "In Los Angeles, the studios and Hollywood grew. Before World War I, movies were made in several US cities, but filmmakers tended to gravitate towards southern California as the industry developed. They were attracted by the warm climate and reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film movies outdoors year-round and by the varied scenery that was available. There are several starting points for cinema (particularly American cinema), but it was Griffith's controversial 1915 epic Birth of a Nation that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still dominates celluloid to this day.", "The movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Caf\u00e9 on 28 December 1895.[241] Many of Paris's concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris's largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.[242]\nBig multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s.

To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west, where Edison's patents could not be enforced.[19] Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry.[20]", "Four major film companies \u2013 Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO, and Columbia \u2013 had studios in Hollywood, as did several minor companies and rental studios. In the 1920s, Hollywood was the fifth-largest industry in the nation.[20]", "Hollywood is the oldest film industry in the world,[10] and is considered the birthplace of various genres of cinema\u2014among them comedy, drama, action, the musical, romance, horror, science fiction and the war epic\u2014having set an example for other national film industries. It produced the world\u2019s first sound (talkie) as well as musical film The Jazz Singer.[11]", "The city's Hollywood neighborhood has become recognized as the center of the motion picture industry. Los Angeles plays host to the annual Academy Awards and is the site of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the oldest film school in the United States.[130]", "With Thomas Edison's invention of the Kinetoscope (early movie camera) in 1894, California would become a leader when \"talkies\" were introduced in the sound film movie industry. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. After the release of The Jazz Singer in 1927, \"talkies\" became more and more commonplace. Within a decade, popular widespread production of silent films had ceased. Cheap land, good year-round climate and large natural spaces prompted the growing film industry to begin migrating to Southern California in the early part of the 20th century. The film patent wars of the early 20th century actually led to the spread of film companies across the U.S.  Many worked with equipment for which they did not own the patent rights, and thus filming in New York was \"dangerous\"; it was too close to Edison's company headquarters, and to his agents which the company sent out to seize \"illegal\" cameras. By 1912, most major film companies had set up movie production facilities in Southern California near or in Los Angeles because of the region's favorable year-round weather and the rapidly growing supply of \"talent\" both before and behind the cameras.[19] Since the 1920s California continues to be a major U.S. center for motion-picture shows, television shows, cartoons, and related entertainment industries, especially in Hollywood and Burbank areas.", "By the late 1890s, the first motion picture companies were established in the US, France, Britain and elsewhere.", "Pre-Code Hollywood refers to the brief era in the American film industry between the widespread adoption of sound in pictures in 1929[1] and the enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code censorship guidelines, popularly known as the \"Hays Code\", in mid-1934. Although the Code was adopted in 1930, oversight was poor and it did not become rigorously enforced until July 1, 1934, with the establishment of the Production Code Administration (PCA). Before that date, movie content was restricted more by local laws, negotiations between the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) and the major studios, and popular opinion, than by strict adherence to the Hays Code, which was often ignored by Hollywood filmmakers.", "Though the expense involved in making films almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed independent film production to evolve. Hollywood is the oldest film industry of the world,[1] and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. Indian cinema (including Bollywood) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually)[2] and 1,986 feature films produced annually.[3]", "In the 1930s, the Democrats and the Republicans saw money in Hollywood. President Franklin Roosevelt saw a huge partnership with Hollywood. He used the first real potential of Hollywood's stars in a national campaign. Melvyn Douglas toured Washington in 1939 and met the key New Dealers.[citation needed]", "Film as an artistic medium was created in the 20th century. The first modern movie theatre was established in Pittsburgh in 1905.[23] Hollywood developed as the center of American film production. While the first films were in black and white, technicolor was developed in the 1920s to allow for color films. Sound films were developed, with the first full-length feature film, The Jazz Singer, released in 1927. The Academy Awards were established in 1929.", "The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the Lumi\u00e8res quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898[citation needed] was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 Charlie Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming until the introduction of videotape recorders.", "From the early 1920s through the early 1950s, the American motion picture had evolved into an industry controlled by a few companies, a condition known as a \"mature oligopoly\", as it was led by eight major film studios, the most powerful of which were the \"Big Five\" studios: MGM, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, and RKO.[4] These studios were fully integrated, not only producing and distributing films, but also operating their own movie theaters; the \"Little Three\", Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists, produced and distributed feature films but did not own theaters.[citation needed]", "In 1919 Hollywood, the then-new motion picture capital of the world, one of the first (and still existing) trade societies was formed: the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), which stood to recognize the cinematographer's contribution to the art and science of motion picture making. Similar trade associations have been established in other countries too.", "Director D. W. Griffith was the first to make a motion picture in Hollywood. His 17-minute short film In\u00a0Old California (1910) was filmed for the Biograph Company.[21][22][23] Although Hollywood banned movie theaters\u2014of which it had none\u2014before annexation that year, Los Angeles had no such restriction.[24] The first film by a Hollywood studio, Nestor Motion Picture Company, was shot on October 26, 1911.[25] The H.\u00a0J. Whitley home was used as its set, and the unnamed movie was filmed in the middle of their groves at the corner of Whitley Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard.[26][27]", "Use of \"star\" for theatrical lead performers dates to 1824, giving rise to the concept of \"stardom\" in the film industry. The Hollywood Walk of Fame, where famous entertainers are honored with pink terrazzo five-pointed stars along Hollywood Boulevard, was introduced in 1958.[10]", "The sign was officially dedicated in 1923. It was intended only to last a year and a half,[7] but after the rise of American cinema in Los Angeles during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the sign became an internationally recognized symbol and was left there.[8]", "Following the westward trend of the industry, by the end of 1912 the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area.", "The movies became America's chief entertainment source featuring western fiction, later the community of Hollywood in Los Angeles became the headquarters of the mass media such as radio and television production.[15]", "The first decades of the twentieth century saw the rise of the film studio system. MGM, Universal and Warner Brothers all acquired land in Hollywood, which was then a small subdivision known as \"Hollywoodland\" on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The enormous variety in terrain and the year-round sunshine made filmmaking easier and cheaper, and actors, producers, financiers and craftsmen headed to Hollywood.", "Significant events in the film industry in the 1960s:", "The years of the First World War were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.", "The era saw the large-scale adoption of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio and household electricity, as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media began to focus on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars. Large baseball stadiums were built in major U.S. cities, in addition to palatial cinemas.", "The narrative and visual style of classical Hollywood style would further develop after the transition to sound-film production. The primary changes in American filmmaking came from the film industry itself, with the height of the studio system. This mode of production, with its reigning star system bankrolled by several key studios, had preceded sound by several years. By mid-1920, most of the prominent American directors and actors, who had worked independently since the early 10s, would have to become a part of the new studio system to continue to work.", "While many today point to the May court ruling, it is actually Hughes's agreement with the federal government - signed November 8, 1948 - that was truly the death knell for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Paramount soon capitulated, entering into a similar consent decree the following February. The studio, which had fought against divorcement for so long, became the first of the majors to break up, ahead of schedule, finalizing divestiture on December 31, 1949. By this time, there were 19,000 movie theaters in the United States.[7]  The Golden Age was over.", "The cinema of the United States, often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early twentieth century. While the Lumiere Brothers are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, it is American cinema that has emerged as the most dominant force in the industry. Its history can be separated into four main periods: the silent film era, classical Hollywood cinema, New Hollywood, and the contemporary period. Actor James Dean, who appeared in films during the classical Hollywood era until his untimely death, is widely regarded as an American cultural icon of teenage disillusionment.", "Sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the Great Depression (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called \"The Golden Age of Hollywood\", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s.

It also mediates respiratory sinus arrhythmia.", "The cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system which normally enable the precise regulation of heart function, via cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons.

Vasomotor center is a fairly archaic term since this function relies not on a single brain structure (\"center\") but rather represents a presympathetic network of interacting neurons.[1] Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors, it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels. This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation, especially in the brain.[2] Cranial nerves IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the vasomotor centre and are themselves involved in the regulation of blood pressure. The localization of VMC was determined by Filipp Ovsyannikov in 1871.[3]", "Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.[11]", "Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself.

The cardiovascular centre also increases the stroke volume of the heart (that is, the amount of blood it pumps). These two changes help to regulate the cardiac output, so that a sufficient amount of blood reaches tissue.", "Blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by the vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve.[84] Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.[85]", "The vasa vasorum are found in large vein and arteries such as the aorta and its branches. These small vessels serve to provide blood supply and nourishment for tunica adventitia and outer parts of tunica media of large vessels.[4]", "Baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched,[50] which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation . As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.[7] There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true.[7] Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.[51]", "Specialized cardiomyocytes located in the sinoatrial node are responsible for generating the electrical impulses that control the heart rate.", "The heart rate is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node. It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.[10] Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.[11]", "The normal sinus rhythm of the heart, giving the resting heart rate, is influenced a number of factors. The cardiovascular centres in the brainstem that control the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences to the heart through the vagus nerve and sympathetic trunk.[49] These cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of receptors including baroreceptors, sensing stretch the stretching of blood vessels and chemoreceptors, sensing the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and its pH. Through a series of reflexes these help regulate and sustain blood flow.[7]", "Baroreceptors are present in the atria of the heart and vena cavae, but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch. While the carotid sinus baroreceptor axons travel within the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the aortic arch baroreceptor axons travel within the vagus nerve (CN X). Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves directly into the central nervous system to contact neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the brainstem. Baroreceptor information flows from these NTS neurons to both parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons within the brainstem.", "Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over the heart rate, but other factors can impact on this. These include hormones, notably epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia; and pH balance.[11]", "Heart; conduction system (SA node labeled 1)", "Relaxin receptors have been found in the heart, smooth muscle, the connective tissue, and central and autonomous nervous system.", "Human cardiac glands (at cardia)", "Throughout the cardiac cycle, blood pressure increases and decreases.

The blood volume determines the mean pressure throughout the system, in particular in the venous side where most of the blood is held.", "As the center focus of cardiology, the heart has numerous anatomical features (e.g., atria, ventricles, heart valves) and numerous physiological features (e.g., systole, heart sounds, afterload) that have been encyclopedically documented for many centuries.", "Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli flow through the paired cardiac plexus near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1\u00e2\u20ac\u201cT4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heartrate.

These specialized receptors are sensitive to changes in mean arterial pressure. An increase in sensed pressure results in an increased rate of firing by the baroreceptors and a negative feedback response, lowering systemic arterial pressure. Aldosterone release causes sodium and water retention, which causes increased blood volume, and a subsequent increase in blood pressure, which is sensed by the baroreceptors.[33] To maintain normal homeostasis these receptors also detect low blood pressure or low blood volume, causing aldosterone to be released. This results in sodium retention in the kidney, leading to water retention and increased blood volume.[34]", "The M2 muscarinic receptors are located in the heart, where they act to slow the heart rate down to normal sinus rhythm, by slowing the speed of depolarization. In humans under resting conditions vagal activity dominates over sympathetic activity. Hence inhibition of m2 receptors (e.g. by atropine) will cause a raise in heart rate. They also moderately reduce contractile forces of the atrial cardiac muscle, and reduce conduction velocity of the atrioventricular node (AV node).

According to Darwin, only the organisms most able to adapt to their environment survived while others became extinct. Adaptations resulted in changes in certain populations of organisms which could eventually cause the creation of new species. Modern genetics started with Gregor Johann Mendel, a German-Czech Augustinian monk who studied the nature of inheritance in plants. In his 1865 paper \"Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden\" (\"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\"), Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically.[36] Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister made discoveries about bacteria and its effects on humans. Geologists at the time made discoveries indicating the world was far older than most believed it to be. Early batteries were invented and a telegraph system was also invented, allowing global communication. In 1869 Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his Periodic table. The success of Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made: The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered. The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as cobalt and nickel, to better classify them into chemical families. At the end of the 19th century, a number of discoveries were made in physics which paved the way for the development of modern physics \u2013 including Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie's work on radioactivity.", "These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.[8]", "In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book On the Origin of Species. This publication sparked the beginning of biocentrist views by introducing evolution and \"its removal of humans from their supernatural origins and placement into the framework of natural laws\".[15]", "Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS[2] (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/;[5] 12\u00a0February 1809\u00a0\u2013 19\u00a0April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist,[6] best known for his contributions to the science of evolution.[I] He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors[7] and, in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.[8]", "In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection: it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry, biogeography, geology, morphology, and embryology. Debate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s. Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution. Alternatives to natural selection suggested during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" (c. 1880 to 1920) included inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change (orthogenesis), and sudden large mutations (saltationism). Mendelian genetics, a series of 19th-century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900, was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s, and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics. During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields, resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe modern synthesis.", "Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the Weismann barrier, or the central dogma of molecular biology.[1] Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life, and it has even been applied to concepts of cosmic evolution, both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work\u2014in place of other theories, including divine design and extraterrestrial origins.[2][3]", "The biogeographical patterns Charles Darwin observed in places such as the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in 1837 Darwin started the first of a series of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 he read the new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a struggle for survival combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the time he could spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection.[73][84][85]", "Universal common descent through an evolutionary process was first proposed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species (1859), which concluded: \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\"[9]", "Sometime during the 1840s Owen came to the conclusion that species arise as the result of some sort of evolutionary process.[5] He believed that there was a total of six possible mechanisms: parthenogenesis, prolonged development, premature birth, congenital malformations, Lamarckian atrophy, Lamarckian hypertrophy and transmutation,[5]of which he thought transmutation was the least likely.[5] The historian of science Evelleen Richards has argued that Owen was likely sympathetic to developmental theories of evolution, but backed away from publicly proclaiming them after the critical reaction that had greeted the anonymously published evolutionary book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844 (it was revealed only decades later that the book had been authored by publisher Robert Chambers). Owen had been criticized for his own evolutionary remarks in his Nature of the Limbs in 1849.[12] At the end of On the Nature of Limbs Owen had suggested that humans ultimately evolved from fish as the result of natural laws,[13] which resulted in his being criticized in the Manchester Spectator for denying that species such as humans were created by God.[5]", "Though Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory was set forth in 1859 upon publication of On the Origin of Species, this work was largely absent of explicit reference to Darwin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory applied to man. This application by Darwin would not become explicit until the publication of his second great book on evolution, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871.", "While the term Darwinism had been used previously to refer to the work of Erasmus Darwin in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the Westminster Review.[12] Having hailed the book as \"a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism\" promoting scientific naturalism over theology, and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's gradualism and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species,[13] Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of Nicolaus Copernicus in explaining planetary motion:", "By mid March 1859 Darwin's abstract had reached the stage where he was thinking of early publication; Lyell suggested the publisher John Murray, and met with him to find if he would be willing to publish. On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances \"that my Book is not more un-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable.\" He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as \"1859\".[64][65]", "The term Darwinism was coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in his March 1861 review of On the Origin of Species,[6] and by the 1870s it was used to describe a range of concepts of evolution or development, without any specific commitment to Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.[7]", "Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction.[12] Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.[13] His pal\u00e6ontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.[14]", "On the Origin of Species (or more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life),[3] published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.[4] Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.[5]", "Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \"law of development\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design.[209] Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.[210]", "By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and seeds could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. Hooker increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend Thomas Henry Huxley was firmly against the transmutation of species. Lyell was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace, \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a \"big book on species\" titled Natural Selection, which was to include his \"note on Man\". He continued his researches, obtaining information and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in Borneo. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist Asa Gray a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of Natural Selection, which omitted human origins and sexual selection. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, \"so surrounded with prejudices\", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that \"I go much further than you.\"[120]", "When Sir John Lubbock was doing the preliminary work for his 1865 magnum opus, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were jointly publishing their first papers On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. Darwins's On the Origin of Species came out in 1859, but he did not elucidate the theory of evolution as it applies to man until the Descent of Man in 1871. Meanwhile, Wallace read a paper in 1864 to the Anthropological Society of London that was a major influence on Sir John, publishing in the very next year.[68] He quoted Wallace:[69]", "The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan.[217] Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \"ordained becoming\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \"creation by birth\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design.[218][219] Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate.[220][221] In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \"great hippopotamus test\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains.[222] Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).[223]", "By September 1854 Darwin's other books reached a stage where he was able to turn his attention fully to Species, and from this point he was working to publish his theory. On 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Alfred Russel Wallace enclosing about twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism that was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin put matters in the hands of his friends Lyell and Hooker, who agreed on a joint presentation to the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. Their papers were entitled, collectively, On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection.", "In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including Louis Agassiz who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it,[87] stating:", "The idea of evolution by natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin put an end to these metaphysical theologies. In a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker on 1 February 1871,[92] Darwin discussed the suggestion that the original spark of life may have begun in a \"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &c., present, that a proteine compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes.\" He went on to explain that \"at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.\" He had written to Hooker in 1863 stating that, \"It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter.\" In On the Origin of Species, he had referred to life having been \"created\", by which he \"really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process\", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term \"creation\".[93]", "Lyell's acceptance of natural selection, Darwin's proposed mechanism for evolution, was equivocal, and came in the tenth edition of Principles.[5][38] The Antiquity of Man (published in early February 1863, just before Huxley's Man's place in nature) drew these comments from Darwin to Huxley:", "Other naturalists of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.[46] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and Erasmus Darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism (or \"filament\").[47] The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's \"transmutation\" theory of 1809,[48] which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents.[49][50] (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.)[49][51][52][53] These ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support. In particular, Georges Cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by William Paley into the Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (1802), which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles Darwin.[54][55][56]", "Sexual selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species (1859) and developed in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), as he felt that natural selection alone was unable to account for certain types of non-survival adaptations. He once wrote to a colleague that \"The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!\" His work divided sexual selection into male-male competition and female choice.", "Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species in 1859.[34] His theory means that all life, including humanity, is a product of continuing natural processes. The implication that all life on Earth has a common ancestor has met with objections from some religious groups. Their objections are in contrast to the level of support for the theory by more than 99 percent of those within the scientific community today.[35]", "Herbert Spencer's ideas, like those of evolutionary progressivism, stemmed from his reading of Thomas Malthus, and his later theories were influenced by those of Darwin. However, Spencer's major work, Progress: Its Law and Cause (1857), was released two years before the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and First Principles was printed in 1860.", "Between 1835 and 1837, the zoologist Edward Blyth worked on the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of On the Origin of Species.[16]", "Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley.[212] Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology,[213][214] praising Darwin for \"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\" and coining the term \"Darwinism\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science.[215] Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies.[212][216]", "While in South America Darwin received Volume 2 which considered the ideas of Lamarck in some detail. Lyell rejected Lamarck's idea of organic evolution, proposing instead \"Centres of Creation\" to explain diversity and territory of species. However, as discussed below, many of his letters show he was fairly open to the idea of evolution.[16] In geology Darwin was very much Lyell's disciple, and brought back observations and his own original theorising, including ideas about the formation of atolls, which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism. On the return of the Beagle (October 1836) Lyell invited Darwin to dinner and from then on they were close friends. Although Darwin discussed evolutionary ideas with him from 1842, Lyell continued to reject evolution in each of the first nine editions of the Principles. He encouraged Darwin to publish, and following the 1859 publication of On the Origin of Species, Lyell finally offered a tepid endorsement of evolution in the tenth edition of Principles.", "He was writing up his theory in 1858 when he received an essay from Alfred Russel Wallace who was in Borneo, describing Wallace's own theory of natural selection, prompting immediate joint publication of extracts from Darwin's 1844 essay together with Wallace's paper as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection in a presentation to the Linnaean Society on 1 July 1858. This attracted little notice,[2] but spurred Darwin to write an \"abstract\" of his work which was published in 1859 as his book On the Origin of Species.[3]", "Evolutionary ideas, although not natural selection, were accepted by German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn's alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives, but enthused political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie.[96][225] Their ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in palaeontology. Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that von Baer's laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.[224]", "In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin formulated the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process first demonstrated by the observation that often, more offspring are produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable facts about living organisms: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).[10] Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.", "Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species.[9][10] By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.[11][12] Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.[13][14]", "In Great Britain, the philosophy of natural theology remained influential. William Paley's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin.[69] Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck, Grant, and Vestiges.[70][71] Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his Principles of Geology, he criticized Lamarck's theories of development.[59] Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of \"archetypes\" in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, and the controversy surrounding Vestiges, showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound.[64][72][73]", "In 1859, Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, \"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\"[25] The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one...\"[25]", "By the time the first edition was published, the development of Darwin's theory of natural selection was in progress. For the 1845 second edition of The Voyage (now titled Journal of Researches), Darwin added more detail about the beaks of the birds, and two closing sentences which reflected his changed ideas: \"Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"[21][22]", "The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection, though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans when he published The Descent of Man in 1871.[47]", "The Church of England's response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \"just as noble a conception of Deity\".[143] In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin, with its ideas including higher criticism attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God's laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature\".[144] Asa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology.[143][145] The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley's legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.[143][146]", "Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.[17] Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.[18] He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories.[19] Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature.[11] In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.[20][21]", "Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Sir Francis Galton who led to the creation of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book \"The Origin of Species\", which pertained to individual differences in animals. This book discussed how individual members in a species differ and how they possess characteristics that are more adaptive and successful or less adaptive and less successful. Those who are adaptive and successful are the ones that survive and give way to the next generation, who would be just as or more adaptive and successful. This idea, studied previously in animals, led to Galton's interest and study of human beings and how they differ one from another, and more importantly, how to measure those differences.", "In the 19th century, several additional scientists contributed new theories to further develop the concept of biogeography. Charles Lyell, being one of the first contributors in the 19th century, developed the Theory of Uniformitarianism after studying fossils. This theory explained how the world was not created by one sole catastrophic event, but instead from numerous creation events and locations.[15] Uniformitarianism also introduced the idea that the Earth was actually significantly older than was previously accepted. Using this knowledge, Lyell concluded that it was possible for species to go extinct.[16] Since he noted that earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climate changes, he realized that species distribution must also change accordingly. Lyell argued that climate changes complemented vegetation changes, thus connecting the environmental surroundings to varying species. This largely influenced Charles Darwin in his development of the theory of evolution.[8]", "Darwin's On the Origin of Species proposed natural selection as the main mechanism for development of species, but did not rule out a variant of Lamarckism as a supplementary mechanism.[13] Darwin called his Lamarckian hypothesis pangenesis, and explained it in the final chapter of his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication (1868), after describing numerous examples to demonstrate what he considered to be the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Pangenesis, which he emphasised was a hypothesis, was based on the idea that somatic cells would, in response to environmental stimulation (use and disuse), throw off 'gemmules' or 'pangenes' which travelled around the body (though not necessarily in the bloodstream). These pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about the characteristics of their parent cell, and Darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in the germ cells where they could pass on to the next generation the newly acquired characteristics of the parents. Darwin's half-cousin, Francis Galton, carried out experiments on rabbits, with Darwin's cooperation, in which he transfused the blood of one variety of rabbit into another variety in the expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of the first. They did not, and Galton declared that he had disproved Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis, but Darwin objected, in a letter to the scientific journal Nature, that he had done nothing of the sort, since he had never mentioned blood in his writings. He pointed out that he regarded pangenesis as occurring in Protozoa and plants, which have no blood.[14]", "Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection on the basis of an understanding of uniform processes in geology, acting over very long periods of time on inheritable variation within populations. One of those processes was competition for resources, as Thomas Malthus had indicated, leading to a struggle to survive and to reproduce. Since some individuals would by chance have traits that allowed them to leave more offspring, those traits would tend to increase in the population. Darwin assembled many lines of evidence to show that variation occurred and that artificial selection by animal and plant breeding had caused change. All of this demanded a reliable mechanism of inheritance.[1]", "Alfred Russel Wallace OM FRS (8 January 1823\u00a0\u2013 7 November 1913) was an English[2] naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, and biologist. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858.[3] This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in On the Origin of Species. Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia.", "Darwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 Lyell's Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection.[148] Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864.[149] That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential \"X Club\" devoted to \"science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas\".[150] By the end of the decade most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin's view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.[151]", "Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level.

This leads to the final verse, with Waters singing a new, repeating melody for the sixteen lines beginning \"Who was...\". Originally sung over the tonic only, in the final recording the multiple harmonized guitars alternate between D minor and C Major, while the bass further extends the harmony with a descending F, E, D, and C, creating the sense of an F sixth chord followed by C/E. Originally, Waters' lyrics (\"Who was born in a house full of pain\", etc.) were echoed by Gilmour and Richard Wright in a round style, but in the final recording only the last few are repeated, and done so by Waters himself, using tape delay.

The English language lyrics were written a few years later by Fred Jay (Friedrich Alex Jacobson IPI number 00015195204, who wrote many hits for Boney M such as Rasputin and Ma Baker). They do not make specific mention of Christmas but the importance they attach to looking forward to the birth of one particular child somewhere, anywhere, suggests a reference to the birth of Jesus Christ, and the citing of \"a tiny star\" that \"lights up way up high\" may allude to the Star of Bethlehem.

The invention of the Cotton Gin by American Eli Whitney made cotton potentially a cheap and readily available resource in the United States for use in the new textile industry.", "Charles F. Hammond from Detroit filed several patents for improvements of power steering with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in 1958.[9][10][11]", "The Voluntary Tender Act of 1917 gave the Commissioner of Patents the authority to withhold certification from inventions that might harm U.S. national security, and to turn the invention over to the United States government for its own use.[56][57] It was replaced in 1951 with the Invention Secrecy Act which prevented inventors from publishing inventions or sharing the information.[58] Both attached criminal penalties to subjected inventors.[59] The United States was under a declared state of emergency from 1950\u20131974, after which peacetime secrecy orders were available.[60][61][62]", "Regulation on industry funded biomedical research has seen great changes since Samuel Hopkins Adams declaration. In 1906 congress passed the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906.[16] In 1912 Congress passed the Shirley Amendment to prohibit the wide dissemination of false information on pharmaceuticals.[16] The Food and Drug Administration was formally created in 1930 under the McNarey Mapes Amendment to oversee the regulation of Food and Drugs in the United States.[16] In 1962 the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act made it so that before a drug was marketed in the United States the FDA must first approve that the drug was safe.[16] The Kefauver-Harris amendments also mandated that more stringent clinical trials must be performed before a drug is brought to the market.[15] The Kefauver-Harris amendments were met with opposition from industry due to the requirement of lengthier clinical trial periods that would lessen the period of time in which the investor is able to see return on their money. In the pharmaceutical industry patents are typically granted for a 20-year period of time, and most patent applications are submitted during the early stages of the product development.[15] According to Ariel Katz on average after a patent application is submitted it takes an additional 8 years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing.[15] As such this would leave a company with only 12 years to market the drug to see a return on their investments. After a sharp decline of new drugs entering the US market following the 1962 Kefauver-Harris amendments economist Sam Petlzman concluded that cost of loss of innovation was greater than the savings recognized by consumers no longer purchasing ineffective drugs.[15] In 1984 the Hatch-Waxman Act or the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 was passed by congress.[16] The Hatch-Waxman Act was passed with the idea that giving brand manufacturers the ability to extend their patent by an additional 5 years would create greater incentives for innovation and private sector funding for investment.[17]"]}, {"query": "the most stable mineral at the earth's surface", "similarities": [0.7518361210823059, 0.7419367432594299, 0.7352621555328369, 0.7325729727745056, 0.7310258746147156, 0.7288810610771179, 0.7260324358940125, 0.7241420745849609, 0.7222517132759094, 0.7220041155815125, 0.7218532562255859, 0.7195284962654114, 0.7193130850791931, 0.7187052369117737, 0.7184827327728271, 0.7178797125816345, 0.7168452143669128, 0.7162472605705261, 0.7156124711036682, 0.7124535441398621, 0.7115138173103333, 0.7090343832969666, 0.7081194519996643, 0.7075018882751465, 0.706791341304779, 0.7066906690597534, 0.7064022421836853, 0.7062751650810242, 0.7056107521057129, 0.7055560350418091, 0.7054216861724854, 0.7042542695999146, 0.7035444378852844, 0.7034779191017151, 0.7032527923583984, 0.7031794190406799, 0.7027778625488281, 0.7026116251945496, 0.7017563581466675, 0.7016149759292603, 0.7013266086578369, 0.7006815671920776, 0.7004212737083435, 0.7002866268157959, 0.6992883086204529, 0.6991091370582581, 0.698792576789856, 0.6983798146247864, 0.6982582807540894, 0.697944700717926], "hits": ["Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO2) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure coesite, and ultra-high pressure stishovite. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO2). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is \u03b1-quartz. Its counterpart, \u03b2-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to \u03b1-quartz below 573\u00a0\u00b0C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a \"kinking\" of bonds; this change in structure gives \u03b2-quartz greater symmetry than \u03b1-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (\u03b2) and low quartz (\u03b1).[86][92]", "The series is broken into two branches, the continuous and the discontinuous. The branch on the right is the continuous. The minerals at the top of the illustration (given aside) are first to crystallize and so the temperature gradient can be read to be from high to low with the high temperature minerals being on the top and the low temperature ones on the bottom. Since the surface of the Earth is a low temperature environment compared to the zones of rock formation, the chart also easily shows the stability of minerals with the ones at bottom being most stable and the ones at top being quickest to weather, known as the Goldich dissolution series. This is because minerals are most stable in the conditions closest to those under which they had formed. Simply put, the high temperature minerals, the first ones to crystallize in a mass of magma, are most unstable at the Earth's surface and quickest to weather because the surface is most different from the conditions under which they were created. On the other hand, the low temperature minerals are much more stable because the conditions at the surface are much more similar to the conditions under which they formed.", "Fluorine is the thirteenth most common element in Earth's crust at 600\u2013700\u00a0ppm (parts per million) by mass.[57] Elemental fluorine in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor, precluding its natural occurrence;[58][59] it is found only in combined mineral forms, of which fluorite, fluorapatite and cryolite are the most industrially significant.[57][60] Fluorite or fluorspar (CaF2), colorful and abundant worldwide, is fluorine's main source; China and Mexico are the major suppliers. The U.S. led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995.[60][61][62][63][64] Although fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) contains most of the world's fluorine, its low mass fraction of 3.5% means that most of it is used as a phosphate. In the U.S. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via fluorosilicic acid, a phosphate industry byproduct.[60] Cryolite (Na3AlF6), once used directly in aluminium production, is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals. The main commercial mine on Greenland's west coast closed in 1987, and most cryolite is now synthesized.[60]", "At 3%, calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant metal behind aluminium and iron.[29] It is also the fourth most abundant element in the lunar highlands.[11] Sedimentary calcium carbonate deposits pervade the Earth's surface as fossilised remains of past marine life; they occur in two forms, the rhombohedral calcite (more common) and the orthorhombic aragonite (forming in more temperate seas). Minerals of the first type include limestone, dolomite, marble, chalk, and iceland spar; aragonite beds make up the Bahamas, the Florida Keys, and the Red Sea basins. Corals, sea shells, and pearls are mostly made up of calcium carbonate. Among the other important minerals of calcium are gypsum (CaSO4\u00c2\u00b72H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4), fluorite (CaF2), and apatite ([Ca5(PO4)3F]).[29]", "With an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum (about 1\u00a0\u00b5g/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements.[15]  In comparison, even the rarest of the stable lanthanides have crustal abundances of 500\u00a0\u00b5g/kg (see Abundance of the chemical elements).[16]", "As the composition of the Earth's crust is dominated by silicon and oxygen, silicate elements are by far the most important class of minerals in terms of rock formation and diversity. However, non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance, especially as ores.[83][84]", "Every single one of these elements is stable,[1] and many are extremely common in the earth's crust and/or core; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all. Many of the transition metals in period 4 are incredibly strong, and therefore commonly used in industry, especially iron. Copper is one of three metals that are not silver or gray in color, along with caesium and gold. Three adjacent elements are known to be toxic, with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons, selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities, and bromine, a very toxic liquid. Many elements are essential to humans' survival, such as calcium being what forms bones.[2]", "The Earth's crust contains 2.27% sodium, making it the seventh most abundant element on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind aluminium, iron, calcium, and magnesium and ahead of potassium.[43] Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08\u00c3\u2014104 milligrams per liter.[44] Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble, such as amphibole and zeolite. The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate.", "The well-crystallized magnetite (Fe3O4) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2 ).[5]", "The well crystallized magnetite (Fe\n3O\n4) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)\n2).", "Non-silicate minerals are subdivided into several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which included native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, pyrite, magnetite, and hematite. There are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. The close-packed structures, which is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space. Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same (\"ababab\"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers (\"abcabcabc\"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO4 (sulfate), PO4 (phosphate), AsO4 (arsenate), and VO4 (vanadate). The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.[85]", "The most common constituent of sand, in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings, is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz, which, because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness, is the most common mineral resistant to weathering.", "Nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere.[3] Despite this, it is not very abundant in Earth's crust, making up only 19\u00c2\u00a0parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.[61]", "Iron is the most common element within the entire earth; most of the core is iron and there is a substantial amount of iron in the mantle and crust as well. Ruthenium and osmium are two of the rarest elements on earth, with ruthenium found only in small amounts in platinum ores. Osmium is the least abundant stable element in the earth's crust, found only in minor traces in platinum ores. Hassium is produced only in nuclear reactors and has never been observed in nature nor isolated in pure form.", "The abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth. The majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust. Eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust. These eight elements, summing to over 98% of the crust by weight, are, in order of decreasing abundance: oxygen, silicon, aluminium, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium. Oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oxygen composes 47% of the crust by weight, and silicon accounts for 28%.[42]", "Magnesium is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron in molarity.[6] It is found in large deposits of magnesite, dolomite, and other minerals, and in mineral waters, where magnesium ion is soluble.", "Ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O, a solid solution of periclase (MgO) and w\u00fcstite (FeO), makes up about 20% of the volume of the lower mantle of the Earth, which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after silicate perovskite (Mg,Fe)SiO3; it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle.[32] At the bottom of the transition zone of the mantle, the reaction \u03b3-(Mg,Fe)2[SiO4] \u2194 (Mg,Fe)[SiO3] + (Mg,Fe)O transforms \u03b3-olivine into a mixture of perovskite and ferropericlase and vice versa. In the literature, this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesiow\u00fcstite.[33] Silicate perovskite may form up to 93% of the lower mantle,[34] and the magnesium iron form, (Mg,Fe)SiO3, is considered to be the most abundant mineral in the Earth, making up 38% of its volume.[35]", "If most nanodiamonds did form in the Solar System, that raises the question of how this is possible. On the surface of Earth, graphite is the stable carbon mineral while larger diamonds can only be formed in the kind of temperatures and pressures that are found deep in the mantle. However, nanodiamonds are close to molecular size: one with a diameter of 2.8\u00a0nm, the median size, contains about 1800 carbon atoms.[4] In very small minerals, surface energy is important and diamonds are more stable than graphite because the diamond structure is more compact. The crossover in stability is between 1 and 5\u00a0nm. At even smaller sizes, a variety of other forms of carbon such as fullerenes can be found as well as diamond cores wrapped in fullerenes.[2]", "Diamond is thermodynamically stable at high pressures and temperatures, with the phase transition from graphite occurring at greater temperatures as the pressure increases. Thus, underneath continents it becomes stable at temperatures of 950 degrees Celsius and pressures of 4.5 gigapascals, corresponding to depths of 150 kilometers or greater. In subduction zones, which are colder, it becomes stable at temperatures of 800 degrees C and pressures of 3.5 gigapascals. At depths greater than 240 km, iron-nickel metal phases are present and carbon is likely to be either dissolved in them or in the form of carbides. Thus, the deeper origin of some diamonds may reflect unusual growth environments.[12][14]", "Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily quartz particles, ranging in size from 2.0 to 0.05\u00a0mm (0.0787 to 0.0020\u00a0in) in diameter. Silt ranges in size from 0.05 to 0.002\u00a0mm (0.002 to 0.00008 in). Clay cannot be resolved by optical microscopes as its particles are 0.002\u00a0mm (7.9\u00d710\u22125\u00a0in) or less in diameter and a thickness of only 10 angstroms (10\u221210 m).[181][182] In medium-textured soils, clay is often washed downward through the soil profile (a process called eluviation) and accumulates in the subsoil (a process called illuviation). There is no clear relationship between the size of soil mineral components and their mineralogical nature: sand and silt particles can be calcareous as well as siliceous,[183] while textural clay (0.002\u00a0mm (7.9\u00d710\u22125\u00a0in)) can be made of very fine quartz particles as well as of multi-layered secondary minerals.[184] Soil mineral components belonging to a given textural class may thus share properties linked to their specific surface area (e.g. moisture retention) but not those linked to their chemical composition (e.g. cation exchange capacity).", "Three groups of minerals often remain in well-weathered soils: silicate clays, very resistant end products including iron and aluminium oxide clays, and very resistant primary minerals such as quartz. In highly weathered soils of humid tropical and subtropical regions, the oxides of iron and aluminium, and certain silicate clays with low Si/Al ratios, predominate because most other constituents have been broken down and removed.", "Because of their strong affinity for oxygen, most lithophile elements are enriched in the Earth's crust relative to their abundance in the solar system. The most reactive s- and f-block metals, which form either saline or metallic hydrides, are known to be extraordinarily enriched on Earth as a whole relative to their solar abundances. This is because during the earliest stages of the Earth's formation the reaction that controlled the stable form of each chemical element was its ability to form compounds with hydrogen. Under these conditions, the s- and f-block metals were strongly enriched during the formation of the Earth. The most enriched elements are rubidium, strontium and barium, which between them account for over 50 percent by mass of all elements heavier than iron in the Earth's crust.", "In Earth's continental crust, the decay of natural radioactive isotopes has had significant involvement in the origin of geothermal heat. The continental crust is abundant in lower density minerals but also contains significant concentrations of heavier lithophilic minerals such as uranium. Because of this, it holds the largest global reservoir of radioactive elements found in the Earth.[10] Especially in layers closer to Earth's surface, naturally occurring isotopes are enriched in the granite and basaltic rocks.[11] These high levels of radioactive elements are largely excluded from the Earth's mantle due to their inability to substitute in mantle minerals and consequent enrichment in partial melts. The mantle is mostly made up of high density minerals with high contents of atoms that have relatively small atomic radii such as magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), and calcium (Ca).[10]", "As the sediment is transported, the unstable minerals are abraded or dissolve to leave more stable minerals, such as quartz. Mature sediments, which contain stable minerals, generally have a smaller variety of minerals than immature sediments, which can contain both stable and unstable minerals. One measure of this maturity is the ZTR index which is a measure of the common resistant minerals found in ultra-weathered sediments: zircon, tourmaline, and rutile.", "Because of its great reactivity, all chlorine in the Earth's crust is in the form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt. It is the second-most abundant halogen (after fluorine) and twenty-first most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. These crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater.", "Metallic iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as iron-nickel alloys from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths. Although iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, comprising about 5%, the vast majority is bound in silicate or more rarely carbonate minerals. The thermodynamic barriers to separating pure iron from these minerals are formidable and energy intensive, therefore all sources of iron used by human industry exploit comparatively rarer iron oxide minerals, primarily hematite.", "Estimates for the Earth's crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight.[16] In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, with the largest concentrations in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources.[16] Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite.[45] A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States.[46] At 20\u00c2\u00a0mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust,[47] lithium is the 25th most abundant element.", "In the Earth's crust, aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by mass) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon).[21] The Earth's crust has a greater abundance of aluminium than the rest of the planet, primarily in aluminium silicates. In the Earth's mantle, which is only 2% aluminium by mass, these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by silica and magnesium oxides. Overall, the Earth is about 1.4% aluminium by mass (eighth in abundance by mass). Aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the Earth than in the Solar system and Universe because the more common elements (hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, carbon as hydrocarbon) are volatile at Earth's proximity to the Sun and large quantities of those were lost.", "Aluminium, in contrast to boron, is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant element. It composes about 8.2% (82,000 ppm) of the Earth, surpassed only by oxygen and silicon.[39] It is like boron, however, in that it is uncommon in nature as a free element. This is due to aluminium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tendency to attract oxygen atoms, forming several aluminium oxides. Aluminium is now known to occur in nearly as many minerals as boron, including garnets, turquoises and beryls, but the main source is the ore bauxite. The world's leading countries in the extraction of aluminium are Ghana, Surinam, Russia and Indonesia, followed by Australia, Guinea and Brazil.[42]", "Most of the elements needed for life are relatively common in the Earth's crust. Aluminium, the third most common element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen and silicon), serves no function in living cells, but is harmful in large amounts.[29] Transferrins can bind aluminium.[30]", "Amphiboles have great variability in chemistry, described variously as a \"mineralogical garbage can\" or a \"mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements\". The backbone of the amphiboles is the [Si8O22]12\u2212; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group ([OH]\u2212), although it can be replaced by a fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion.[105] Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+.[103] Several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as asbestosis; amphibole asbestos (anthophyllite, tremolite, actinolite, grunerite, and riebeckite) are considered more dangerous than chrysotile serpentine asbestos.[106]", "Hafnium is estimated to make up about 5.8 ppm of the Earth's upper crust by mass. It does not exist as a free element on Earth, but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO4, which usually has about 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral hafnon (Hf,Zr)SiO4, with atomic Hf > Zr.[11] An old (obsolete) name for a variety of zircon containing unusually high Hf content is alvite.[12]", "The largest grouping of minerals by far are the silicates; most rocks are composed of greater than 95% silicate minerals, and over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of these minerals.[86] The two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen, which are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the Earth's crust, such aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium.[87] Some important rock-forming silicates include the feldspars, quartz, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and micas.", "Recent advances in high-resolution genetics and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between microorganisms and minerals that may make Nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and Skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity.[8][14] For example, the IMA commissioned \"Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry Working Group\"[15] deals with minerals in the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. The group's scope includes mineral-forming microorganisms, which exist on nearly every rock, soil, and particle surface spanning the globe to depths of at least 1600 metres below the sea floor and 70 kilometres into the stratosphere (possibly entering the mesosphere).[16][17][18] Biogeochemical cycles have contributed to the formation of minerals for billions of years. Microorganisms can precipitate metals from solution, contributing to the formation of ore deposits. They can also catalyze the dissolution of minerals.[19][20][21]", "Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth, both being among the ten most common elements in Earth's crust;[169][170] sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall[171] and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element.[171] Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite.[171] Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea.[6]:69 Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.[6]:69", "Coordination polyhedra are geometric representation of how a cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron \u2013 one Si4+ surrounded by four O2\u2212. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: in the case of the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination by oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination number because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers between leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure such as in the mantle, many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and garnet will change to a perovskite structure, where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Another example are the aluminosilicates kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite (polymorphs, as they share the formula Al2SiO5), which differ by the coordination number of the Al3+; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature.[42] In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.[47]", "All three stable elements occur in heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.[12][13][14][15][16]", "A proposal to mine fluorine-containing minerals as a source of CFCs and PFCs is supported by the belief that because these minerals are expected to be at least as common on Mars as on Earth, this process could sustain the production of sufficient quantities of optimal greenhouse compounds (CF3SCF3, CF3OCF2OCF3, CF3SCF2SCF3, CF3OCF2NFCF3, C12F27N) to maintain Mars at 'comfortable' temperatures, as a method of maintaining an Earth-like atmosphere produced previously by some other means.[9]", "The highest level of purely natural radiation ever recorded on the Earth's surface was 90\u00a0\u00b5Gy/h on a Brazilian black beach (areia preta in Portuguese) composed of monazite.[22] This rate would convert to 0.8 Gy/a for year-round continuous exposure, but in fact the levels vary seasonally and are much lower in the nearest residences. The record measurement has not been duplicated and is omitted from UNSCEAR's latest reports. Nearby tourist beaches in Guarapari and Cumuruxatiba were later evaluated at 14 and 15\u00a0\u00b5Gy/h.[23][24]", "The mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth's crust is approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminum 8.2%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%. Other elements occur at less than 0.15%. For a complete list, see abundance of elements in Earth's crust.", "The following table lists principal metal oxides of Earth's Crust. Theoretically, up to 22% of this mineral mass is able to form carbonates.", "The mass-abundance of the eight most abundant elements in the Earth's mantle (see main article above) is approximately: oxygen 45%, magnesium 23%, silicon 22%, iron 5.8%, calcium 2.3%, aluminum 2.2%, sodium 0.3%, potassium 0.3%.", "Titanium is the ninth-most abundant element in Earth's crust (0.63% by mass)[20] and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most igneous rocks, in sediments derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water.[5][6] Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.[20]", "Metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are pervasive and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium.[28][29] Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.[30][31]", "Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure free element in nature. It is most widely distributed in dusts, sands, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. Over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after oxygen.[7]", "The composition of almost all lava of the Earth's crust is dominated by silicate minerals, mostly feldspars, olivine, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas and quartz.", "Mantle rocks shallower than about 410\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) depth consist mostly of olivine, pyroxenes, spinel-structure minerals, and garnet;[26] typical rock types are thought to be peridotite,[26] dunite (olivine-rich peridotite), and eclogite. Between about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) and 650\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) depth, olivine is not stable and is replaced by high pressure polymorphs with approximately the same composition: one polymorph is wadsleyite (also called beta-spinel type), and the other is ringwoodite (a mineral with the gamma-spinel structure). Below about 650\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi), all of the minerals of the upper mantle begin to become unstable. The most abundant minerals present, the silicate perovskites, have structures (but not compositions) like that of the mineral perovskite followed by the magnesium/iron oxide ferropericlase.[33] The changes in mineralogy at about 400 and 650\u00a0km (250 and 400\u00a0mi) yield distinctive signatures in seismic records of the Earth's interior, and like the moho, are readily detected using seismic waves. These changes in mineralogy may influence mantle convection, as they result in density changes and they may absorb or release latent heat as well as depress or elevate the depth of the polymorphic phase transitions for regions of different temperatures. The changes in mineralogy with depth have been investigated by laboratory experiments that duplicate high mantle pressures, such as those using the diamond anvil.[34]", "Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust.

This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite (manganese(II) carbonate). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II).[9][9] There are no spin-allowed d\u2013d transitions in manganese(II), explaining why manganese(II) compounds are typically pale to colorless.[10]", "Ocean chemistry may also control which mineral shells are constructed of. Calcium carbonate has two forms, the stable calcite, and the metastable aragonite, which is stable within a reasonable range of chemical environments but rapidly becomes unstable outside this range. When the oceans contain a relatively high proportion of magnesium compared to calcium, aragonite is more stable, but as the magnesium concentration drops, it becomes less stable, hence harder to incorporate into an exoskeleton, as it will tend to dissolve."]}, {"query": "how many games in a row have the uconn women's basketball team won", "similarities": [0.7924960851669312, 0.784317135810852, 0.7827568054199219, 0.7813714146614075, 0.7809538841247559, 0.7803348302841187, 0.7694669961929321, 0.763918399810791, 0.7621040344238281, 0.7588764429092407, 0.7584705948829651, 0.7570475339889526, 0.7533690929412842, 0.751184344291687, 0.7486858367919922, 0.7485387921333313, 0.7395405173301697, 0.7378758192062378, 0.7365100383758545, 0.7360369563102722, 0.7351469993591309, 0.7339474558830261, 0.7333122491836548, 0.7332911491394043, 0.7311803698539734, 0.7265734076499939, 0.7264617085456848, 0.7243775725364685, 0.7240378856658936, 0.7239475250244141, 0.7215489745140076, 0.7212166786193848, 0.72057044506073, 0.7177773714065552, 0.7159039974212646, 0.7138790488243103, 0.7133503556251526, 0.7129707336425781, 0.712454617023468, 0.7118480801582336, 0.7116575241088867, 0.7108914256095886, 0.7097223997116089, 0.709522008895874, 0.7093267440795898, 0.7088998556137085, 0.7088888883590698, 0.7088378667831421, 0.7076975107192993, 0.7051564455032349], "hits": ["The UConn Huskies are the most successful women's basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships and a women's record four in a row, from 2013 through 2016,[2] plus over 40 conference regular season and tournament championships.", "Beginning after their loss to Stanford in the fall of 2014, the Huskies went on a 111-game winning streak.

The wreck could not be located at the time and was not discovered until 1985. Numerous expeditions tried using sonar to map the sea bed in the hope of spotting it, but were unsuccessful. The wreck was finally located by a joint French\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The wreck has been the focus of intense interest since its discovery and has been visited by numerous expeditions, including salvage operations which have controversially recovered thousands of items which have been conserved and put on public display.", "The sinking of the RMS Titanic occurred on the night of 14 April through to the morning of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224\u00a0people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14\u00a0April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.", "The team discovered that Titanic had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6\u00a0km) apart in Titanic Canyon off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located 13.2 miles (21.2\u00a0km) from the inaccurate coordinates given by Titanic's radio operators on the night of her sinking,[229] and approximately 715 miles (1,151\u00a0km) from Halifax and 1,250 miles (2,012\u00a0km) from New York.", "The location of the wreck is a considerable distance from the location transmitted by the ship's wireless operators before she went down.

The collision caused the ship's hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; she could only survive four flooding. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a \"women and children first\" protocol for loading lifeboats.[4] At 2:20\u00a0a.m., she broke apart and foundered\u2014with well over one thousand people still aboard.

She embarks on her maiden voyage using the same route the Titanic took 100 years before in reverse direction (from New York City, New York, US to Southampton, England, United Kingdom). During the Atlantic crossing, back up near the Glacier, an even larger chunk of ice collapses into the water, creating a tsunami that sends an iceberg crashing into the ship, while the passengers are celebrating in the dining saloon. The entire starboard side of the ship and the starboard lifeboat ramps are crushed; immense pressure is placed on the ship's turbines. As people struggle to escape the rising waters and run for the submarine-shaped lifeboats on the port side, the turbines eventually explode, killing many people, including ship captain Will Howard; the explosion also causes an immense fire on the Titanic II, which is sinking by its bow while also listing at a shallow angle to its starboard side.", "The passengers of the RMS Titanic were among the estimated 2,344 people who sailed on the maiden voyage of the second of the White Star Line's Olympic class ocean liners, from Southampton, England to New York City, New York, US.[1] Partway through the voyage, the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the early morning of 15 April 1912, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 people,[2] including approximately 815 of the passengers.[3]", "Butt left on a six-week vacation in Europe on March 1, 1912, accompanied by Millet.[34] Butt booked passage on the R.M.S. Titanic to return to the United States. He boarded the ship at Southampton, in England on April 10, 1912; Millet boarded the ship at Cherbourg, France, later that same day. Butt was playing cards on the night of April 14 in the first-class smoking room when the Titanic struck an iceberg.[35] The ship sank two and a half hours later, with a loss of over 1,500 lives.[36]", "Titanic was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[225] The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m) below the surface, in a location where the water pressure is over 6,500 pounds per square inch (450\u00a0bar).[226] A number of expeditions were mounted to find Titanic but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by Robert Ballard succeeded.[227][228]", "About 710\u00a0people survived the disaster and were conveyed by Carpathia to New York, Titanic's original destination, while at least 1,500\u00a0people lost their lives.[98] Carpathia's captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20\u00a0large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61\u00a0m) high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from Titanic; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.[162] This area is now known as Iceberg Alley.[163]", "Titanic was planned to arrive at New York Pier 54[124] on the morning of 17 April.[125] After leaving Queenstown Titanic followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock,[126] a distance of some 55 nautical miles (63\u00a0mi; 102\u00a0km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860\u00a0mi; 3,000\u00a0km) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as \"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. Titanic sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177\u00a0mi; 1,895\u00a0km) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[127] The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222\u00a0mi; 357\u00a0km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.[128]", "This staircase was located just aft of where the Titanic broke apart during the sinking and was totally destroyed. It is assumed to be the source of much of the woodwork recovered as wreckage after the sinking.", "In addition to the above-listed passengers, the Titanic carried 29 cross-channel passengers who boarded at Southampton and disembarked at either Cherbourg, France[83] or Queenstown, Ireland.[84]", "The wreck of Titanic was first discovered in 1985 (more than 70\u00a0years after the disaster), and the vessel remains on the seabed. The ship was split in two and is gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12,415 feet (3,784\u00a0m). Since her discovery in 1985, thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world. Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history; her memory is kept alive by numerous works of popular culture, including books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials. Titanic is the second largest ocean liner wreck in the world, only beaten by her sister HMHS\u00a0Britannic, the largest ever sunk.", "The SS America was beached at the Canary islands, in the nineties. However, the ocean liner broke apart after the corse of several years and eventually sank beneath the surface.", "Whilst in command of the White Star SS Titanic that great ship struck an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean during the night and speedily sank with nearly all who were on board. Captain Smith having done all man could do for the safety of passengers and crew remained at his post on the sinking ship until the end. His last message to the crew was \"Be British.\"[34]", "The last gallery presents Titanic as she is now, 12,000 feet (3,700\u00c2\u00a0m) below the surface of the North Atlantic. Presented in conjunction with the discoverer of the wreck of Titanic, Dr Robert Ballard, the gallery illustrates his expeditions to the ship through footage, audio and images. A fish-eye view of the wreck is set under the glass floor. Below the floor is the Ocean Exploration Centre, Titanic Belfast's principal educational facility, which shows marine biology and exploration in Northern Ireland's coastal waters as well as Ballard's various expeditions around the world.[16]", "Most of the major trans-Atlantic liners of the day docked at the piers and they played pivotal roles in the RMS Titanic and RMS Lusitania disasters. The two most memorable moments for the pier were with the Lusitania and Titanic. The RMS Lusitania left her Cunard Pier 54 in 1915 before being torpedoed by German submarine U-20. The RMS Titanic was destined for the White Star pier 59 when she sank. Survivors were rescued on Cunard's RMS Carpathia. The Carpathia dropped off the Titanic's lifeboats at Pier 59 before going back south to Pier 54 where she unloaded the passengers and survivors. Thousands of people assembled at the dock to greet the ship.", "The crew of the RMS Titanic were among the estimated 2,344 people who sailed on the maiden voyage of the second of the White Star Line's Olympic class ocean sea liners, from Southampton, England to New York City in the US.[1] Halfway through the voyage, the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the early morning of 15 April 1912, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 people,[2] including approximately 688 crew members.[3]", "1,512 people did not make it on to a lifeboat and were aboard Titanic when she sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean at 2:20\u00a0a.m. on 15 April 1912. 712 people, mostly women and children, remained in the lifeboats until later that morning when they were rescued by RMS Carpathia. Those aboard the lifeboats were picked up by Carpathia over the course of 4 hours and 30 minutes, from about 4\u00a0a.m. to 8:30\u00a0a.m., and 13 of the lifeboats were also taken aboard. The lifeboats were returned to the White Star Line at New York Harbor, as they were the only items of value salvaged from the shipwreck, but subsequently vanished from history over time.", "At the time the Titanic sank, the 1 May 1912 issue of The Popular Magazine, an American pulp magazine, was on the news stands. It contained the short story \"The White Ghost of Disaster,\" which described the collision of an ocean liner with an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean, the sinking of the vessel, and the fate of the passengers. The story, by Mayn Clew Garnett (the pseudonym of sea-story author T. Jenkins Hains), created a minor sensation.[34][35] In 1898, fourteen years prior to the Titanic disaster, Morgan Robertson wrote a book called Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan. This story features an enormous British passenger liner called the Titan, which, deemed to be unsinkable, carries insufficient lifeboats. On a voyage in the month of April, the Titan hits an iceberg and sinks in the North Atlantic with the loss of almost everyone on board. There are some similarities between the fictional sinking of the Titan and the real-life sinking of the RMS Titanic.[36]", "After they went under, the bow and stern took only a few minutes to sink 3,795 metres (12,451\u00a0ft), spilling a trail of heavy machinery, tons of coal and large quantities of debris from Titanic's interior. The two parts of the ship landed about 600 metres (2,000\u00a0ft) apart on a gently undulating area of the seabed.[172] The streamlined bow section continued to descend at about the angle it had taken on the surface, striking the seabed prow-first at a shallow angle[173] at an estimated speed of 25\u201330\u00a0mph (40\u201348\u00a0km/h). Its momentum caused it to dig a deep gouge into the seabed and buried the section up to 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) deep in sediment before it came to an abrupt halt. The sudden deceleration caused the bow's structure to buckle downwards by several degrees just forward of the bridge. The decks at the rear end of the bow section, which had already been weakened during the break-up, collapsed one atop another.[174]", "Collapsible Boat A reached the deck the right way up and was being attached to the falls by Murdoch and Moody when it was washed off Titanic at 2:15\u00a0a.m. In the chaos, the canvas sides were not pulled up and the boat drifted away from the ship partially submerged and dangerously overloaded. Many of the occupants climbed in from the water but many (at least seven or eight, including the first class passenger Thomson Beattie, the third class passengers Arthur Keefe, Edvard Lindell and Gerda Lindell, and a couple of firemen) died of hypothermia or fell back into the sea. By the time the survivors were transferred into Collapsible Boat D, only about 12 or 13 people were left alive, Rhoda Abbott, who had lost her two young sons in the water, being the only female. Three bodies, including that of Mr. Beattie, were left in Collapsible A, which was allowed to drift off; they were not recovered until a month later, by RMS\u00a0Oceanic, another White Star Line ship.[102]", "When Titanic sank in 1912 and Britannic sank in 1916, their sinkings did not receive the same attention, due to the death toll (1,517 on Titanic and 30 on Britannic). Because the exact position of the sinking of the Britannic is known and the location is shallow, the wreck was discovered relatively easily in 1975.[55] Titanic, however, drew everyone's attention in 1912. After several attempts, the wreck was finally located by Jean-Louis Michel of Ifremer and Robert Ballard following a secret mission for the US Navy.[56] The discovery of the wreck occurred on 1 September 1985, at 25 kilometres from the position given of the sinking. The wreck lies about 4,000 metres deep, broken in two. The bow is relatively well preserved, but the stern partially imploded, and to a large extent disintegrated during the descent and impact on the seabed.[c]", "At the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" flanking the clock face.[55] The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.[57] During the filming of James Cameron's Titanic in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.[58]", "Almost immediately after Titanic sank on 15 April 1912, proposals were advanced to salvage her from her resting place in the North Atlantic Ocean, despite her exact location and condition being unknown. The families of several wealthy victims of the disaster \u2013 the Guggenheims, Astors, and Wideners \u2013 formed a consortium and contracted the Merritt and Chapman Derrick and Wrecking Company to raise Titanic.[1] The project was soon abandoned as impractical as the divers could not even reach a significant fraction of the necessary depth, where the pressure is over 6,000 pounds per square inch (410\u00a0bar). The lack of submarine technology at the time as well as the outbreak of World War I also put off such a project.[2] The company considered dropping dynamite on the wreck to dislodge bodies which would float to the surface, but finally gave up after oceanographers suggested that the extreme pressure would have compressed the bodies into gelatinous lumps.[3] (In fact, this was incorrect. Whale falls, a phenomenon not discovered until 1987 \u2013 coincidentally, by the same submersible used for the first manned expedition to Titanic the year before[4] \u2013 demonstrate that water-filled corpses, in this case cetaceans, can sink to the bottom essentially intact.[5] The high pressure and cold temperature of the water would have prevented significant quantities of gas forming during decomposition, preventing the bodies of Titanic victims from rising back to the surface.[6])", "Later that day, confirmation came through that Titanic had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died.[166] The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,[167] Southampton,[168] Liverpool and Belfast.[169] It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking.[170] Four out of every five crew members came from this town.[171][n]", "The Grand Staircase is the name sometimes given to the large ornate staircases in the first-class section of the White Star Line liner RMS Titanic, which sank following a collision with an iceberg in 1912. The staircase has been prominently featured in Titanic media and often recreated in film, making it one of the most recognizable features of the lost liner.", "On 9 November 1915, while en route from Salonica to Marseilles, she was torpedoed and sunk approximately 60 miles (50\u00a0nmi; 100\u00a0km) south-southwest of Cape Matapan, Greece by the German U-boat U-35, killing one person. To date, Californian's wreck remains undiscovered.[47] The Californian went down less than 200 miles (170\u00a0nmi; 320\u00a0km) from the location where HMHS Britannic, Titanic's sister ship, would be sunk by a mine just over a year later.", "The last Titanic body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel Algerine on 22 May and buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax on 12 June.[223]", "From 11 April to local apparent noon the next day, Titanic covered 484 nautical miles (557\u00a0mi; 896\u00a0km); the following day, 519 nautical miles (597\u00a0mi; 961\u00a0km); and by noon on the final day of her voyage, 546 nautical miles (628\u00a0mi; 1,011\u00a0km). From then until the time of her sinking she travelled another 258 nautical miles (297\u00a0mi; 478\u00a0km), averaging about 21 knots (24\u00a0mph; 39\u00a0km/h).[129]", "It was not until about 12:45\u00a0a.m., an hour after Titanic struck the iceberg at 11:40\u00a0p.m. on 14 April, that the first lifeboat was lowered into the sea. The boats were lowered in sequence, from the middle forward then aft, with First Officer William McMaster Murdoch, Third Officer Herbert Pitman and Fifth Officer Harold Lowe working on the starboard side, and Chief Officer Henry Tingle Wilde and Second Officer Charles Lightoller working on the port side, with the assistance of Captain Smith. The collapsible boats were dealt with last, as they could not be launched until the forward davits were clear.[26]", "The Titanic disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton, Liverpool and Belfast in the United Kingdom; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.[258] A number of museums around the world have displays on Titanic. In Northern Ireland, the ship is commemorated by the Titanic Belfast visitor attraction, opened on 31 March 2012, that stands on the site of the shipyard where Titanic was built.[259]", "Second in line of the Olympic class, Titanic was launched on 31 May 1911,[48] and her commissioning was slightly delayed due to ongoing repairs of Olympic.[49] The ship left the port of Southampton 10 April 1912 for her maiden voyage, narrowly avoiding a collision with SS New York, a ship moored in the port pulled by the propellers of Titanic. After a stopover at Cherbourg, France and another in Queenstown, Ireland, she sailed into the Atlantic with 2,200 passengers on board (a total capacity of 3,500), under the command of Captain Edward J. Smith headed for New York City. The crossing took place without major incident until Sunday, 14 April at 23:40.[50]", "In 1985, two scientists discovered the RMS Titanic in the northern waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada [15] Within the wreck, 1,800 artifacts were found, deeming the discovery a very important contribution to the field of Underwater Cultural Heritage [16] The Titanic has raised significant questions surrounding the remaining passengers, the value of the wreck and the items lost therein, as well as the impact of the accident [17] The discovery of the ship, and other sunken wrecks, may have also raised questions about the legal framework of the UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.", "In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration carried out two expeditions to Titanic. The first, carried out between 22 June and 2 July 2003, performed four dives in two days. Its key aims were to assess the current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis. The microbial colonies aboard Titanic were also a key focus of investigation.[57] The second expedition, from 27 May\u00a0\u2013 12 June 2004, saw the return of Robert Ballard to Titanic nearly 20 years after he discovered it. The expedition spent 11 days on the wreck, carrying out high-resolution mapping using video and stereoscopic still images.[58]", "Prior to the discovery of Titanic's wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet (4 kilometres) down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about 1\u20132\u00a0\u00b0C (34\u201336\u00a0\u00b0F), there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms would not be able to gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze.[89] The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes\u00a0\u2013 physical, chemical and biological.[90] She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull.[73] The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull.[91] Salt corrosion eats away at the hull[90] and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.[91]", "The maiden voyage of Titanic in April 1912 was originally planned to depart from Liverpool, as Liverpool was its port of registration and the home of owners White Star Line. However, it was changed to depart from Southampton instead.", "Fleet boarded the Titanic in Southampton on 10 April 1912. The ship made two stops, first in Cherbourg, France and Queenstown, in Ireland. The lookouts, six in total, made two-hour shifts due to extreme cold in the crow's nest.[6] The trip was uneventful until the night of 14 April 1912. At 22:00 (10PM) that night, Fleet and his fellow lookout Reginald Lee replaced George Symons and Archie Jewell at the nest.[7] They passed on the order given earlier to them by second officer Charles Lightoller to watch out for small ice.[8] The night was calm and moonless, which made it difficult to spot the icebergs due to the lack of waves breaking against the base of the iceberg and reflection.[9] Furthermore, despite repeated requests for binoculars, they were not available for the lookouts. It is sometimes attributed to the last-minute change in the hierarchy of the ship when officer David Blair was replaced by Henry Tingle Wilde, without Blair mentioning where the binoculars had been located. It has been also mentioned that Blair accidentally took the keys of the cabinet containing the binoculars with him.[10] Despite both inquiries into the disaster, nothing clarified why the lookouts were not provided with binoculars, though there are many explanations such as one that the White Star Line steamers' lookouts did not particularly use them.[11] Besides, some experts have said that even using binoculars, neither Fleet nor Lee could have spotted the iceberg any sooner given the conditions of the night.[12]", "As Titanic approached her fatal collision, most passengers had gone to bed and command of the bridge had passed from Second Officer Charles Lightoller to First Officer William Murdoch. Lookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee were occupying the crow's nest, 29 metres (95\u00c2\u00a0ft) above the deck. The air temperature had fallen to near freezing, and the ocean was completely calm. Colonel Archibald Gracie, one of the survivors of the disaster, later wrote that \"the sea was like glass, so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected.\"[27] It is now known that such exceptionally calm water is a sign of nearby pack ice.[28]", "Some believe that there was another ship, the Norwegian sealer Samson, in the vicinity of Titanic when she sank. There is also speculation that this was the ship Titanic saw in the distance instead of the Californian. If correct, the coordinates of Samson place her within 10 miles of Titanic's position as the ship was sinking. The story of crewmate Hendrik Bergethon Naess suggests that when Titanic set off her distress rockets, Samson did not come to the rescue because she was illegally hunting seals, and instead thought that the rockets being fired off was a signal to other ships in regard to Samson being there. His statement allegedly states that they sailed north to avoid detection after seeing the rockets.[28] However, research of Lloyd's List records suggests that Samson was in port in Iceland for engine repairs on the date of the Titanic's sinking, making her presence near the incident on the night of April 14 impossible.[29][30] Another possible candidate is the SS Mount Temple.[citation needed][clarification needed]", "\"The Titanic\" (also known as \"It Was Sad When That Great Ship Went Down\" and \"Titanic (Husbands and Wives)\") is a folk song and children's song most known for being sung in the United States at girl scout summer camps. \"The Titanic\" is about the sinking of the RMS Titanic which sank on April 15, 1912 after striking an iceberg.", "Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean \u2014 in her possession all along \u2014 and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

Independently of Spooner, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural Germany.[26]", "Microcredit organizations were initially created as alternatives to the \"loan-sharks\" known to take advantage of clients.[3] Indeed, many microlenders began as non-profit organizations and operated with government funds or private subsidies. By the 1980s, however the \"financial systems approach,\" influenced by neoliberalism and propagated by the Harvard Institute for International Development, became the dominant ideology among microcredit organizations. The commercialization of microcredit officially began in 1984 with the formation of Unit Desa (BRI-UD) within the Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Unit Desa offered \u2018kupedes\u2019 microloans based on market interest rates.", "Ideas relating to microcredit can be found at various times in modern history, such as the Starr-Bowkett Society. Jonathan Swift inspired the Irish Loan Funds of the 18th and 19th centuries.[8] In the mid-19th century, Individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner wrote about the benefits of numerous small loans for entrepreneurial activities to the poor as a way to alleviate poverty.[9] At about the same time, but independently to Spooner, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural Germany.[10] In the 1950s, Akhtar Hameed Khan began distributing group-oriented credit in East Pakistan. Khan used the Comilla Model, in which credit is distributed through community-based initiatives.[3] The project failed due to the over-involvement of the Pakistani government, and the hierarchies created within communities as certain members began to exert more control over loans than others.[3]", "In 1976, during visits to the poorest households in the village of Jobra near Chittagong University, Yunus discovered that very small loans could make a disproportionate difference to a poor person. Village women who made bamboo furniture had to take usurious loans to buy bamboo, and repay their profits to the lenders. Traditional banks did not want to make tiny loans at reasonable interest to the poor due to high risk of default.[20] But Yunus believed that, given the chance, the poor will repay the money and hence microcredit was a viable business model.[21] Yunus lent US$27 of his money to 42 women in the village, who made a profit of BDT 0.50 (US$0.02) each on the loan. Thus, Yunus is credited with the idea of microcredit.", "In the late 1980s, microfinance institutions developed in the United States. They served low-income and marginalized minority communities.

In nations with lower population densities, meeting the operating costs of a retail branch by serving nearby customers has proven considerably more challenging. Hans Dieter Seibel, board member of the European Microfinance Platform, is in favour of the group model. This particular model (used by many Microfinance institutions) makes financial sense, he says, because it reduces transaction costs. Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds.[25]", "His concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries also inspired programs such as the Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme.[17][18][19]", "In 1976, the foundation helped launch the Grameen Bank, which offers small loans to the rural poor of Bangladesh.

In particular the outstanding success of the work of Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh with the Grameen Bank from its inception in 1976, has led to the attempts to spread microenterprise credit schemes around the world. Yunus saw that social problems like poverty and disease were not being solved by the market system on its own. Thus, he established a banking system which lends to the poor with very little interest, allowing them access to entrepreneurship. [20] This work was honoured by the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.", "From 1974 to 1980 the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people in the developing world. The size and number of loans to borrowers was greatly increased as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors.[10]", "Microcredit is part of microfinance, which provides a wider range of financial services, especially savings accounts, to the poor. Modern microcredit is generally considered to have originated with the Grameen Bank founded in Bangladesh in 1983.[3] Many traditional banks subsequently introduced microcredit despite initial misgivings. The United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of Microcredit. As of 2012, microcredit is widely used in developing countries and is presented as having \"enormous potential as a tool for poverty alleviation.\"[4] Microcredit is a tool that can be helpful to possibly reduce feminization of poverty in developing countries.", "The microcredit movement that began in the 1970s has emerged and morphed into a 'financial systems' approach for creating universal financial inclusion.  While Grameen model of delivering small credit achieved a great deal, especially in urban and near-urban areas and with entrepreneurial families, its progress in delivering financial services in less densely populated rural areas was slow; creating the need for many and multiple models to emerge across the globe. The terms have evolved from Microcredit, to Microfinance, and now Financial Inclusion. Specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs) continue to expand their services, collaborating and competing with banks, credit unions, mobile money, and other informal and formal member owned institutions.", "In November 1954, the administration decided to endorse the proposed International Finance Corporation, which as part of the World Bank would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.[85] The IFC idea had been discussed by the World Bank with the Truman administration since the late 1940s and had been supported by the 1951 report of the \"International Development Advisory Board\" established by Pres.

Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could play an important role in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms, rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests.[10] In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars)[11] in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars)[11] loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG).[3] In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking.[12] In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), Eurobank (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National Bank of Greece (20 million).[13]", "Grameen Bank in Bangladesh is the oldest and probably best-known microfinance institution in the world. Grameen Bank launched their US operations in New York in April 2008.[18] Bank of America has announced plans to award more than $3.7 million in grants to nonprofits to use in backing microloan programs.[19] The Accion U.S. Network, the US subsidiary of the better-known Accion International, has provided over $450 million in microloans since 1991, with an over 90% repayment rate.[20] One research study of the Grameen model shows that poorer individuals are safer borrowers because they place more value on the relationship with the bank.[21] Even so, efforts to replicate Grameen-style solidarity lending in developed countries have generally not succeeded. For example, the Calmeadow Foundation tested an analogous peer-lending model in three locations in Canada during the 1990s. It concluded that a variety of factors \u2014 including difficulties in reaching the target market, the high risk profile of clients, their general distaste for the joint liability requirement, and high overhead costs \u2014 made solidarity lending unviable without subsidies.[22] Microcredits have also been introduced in Israel,[23] Russia, Ukraine and other nations where micro-loans help small business entrepreneurs overcome cultural barriers in the mainstream business society. The Israel Free Loan Association (IFLA) has lent more than $100 million in the past two decades to Israeli citizens of all backgrounds.[citation needed][24]", "The origins of microcredit in its current practical incarnation can be linked to several organizations founded in Bangladesh, especially the Grameen Bank. The Grameen Bank, which is generally considered the first modern microcredit institution, was founded in 1983 by Muhammad Yunus.[3] Yunus began the project in a small town called Jobra, using his own money to deliver small loans at low-interest rates to the rural poor. Grameen Bank was followed by organizations such as BRAC in 1972 and ASA in 1978.[11]  Microcredit reached Latin America with the establishment of PRODEM in Bolivia in 1986; a bank that later transformed into the for-profit BancoSol.[12] Microcredit quickly became a popular tool for economic development, with hundreds of institutions emerging throughout the third world.[3] Though the Grameen Bank was formed initially as a non-profit organization dependent upon government subsidies, it later became a corporate entity and was renamed Grameen II in 2002.[11] Muhammad Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work providing microcredit services to the poor.[13]", "Though lending to groups has long been a key part of microcredit,[citation needed] microcredit initially began with the principle of lending to individuals.[11]  Despite the use of solidarity circles in 1970s Jobra, Grameen Bank and other early microcredit institutions initially focused on individual lending.[12]  (A solidarity circle is a group of borrowers that provide mutual encouragement, information, and assistance in times of need, though loans remain the responsibility of individuals.[15][16])\nIndeed, Muhammad Yunus propagated the notion that every person has the potential to become an entrepreneur. The use of group-lending was motivated by economics of scale, as the costs associated with monitoring loans and enforcing repayment are significantly lower when credit is distributed to groups rather than individuals.[12]  Many times the loan to one participant in group-lending depends upon the successful repayment from another member, thus transferring repayment responsibility off of microcredit institutions to loan recipients.[12]", "Muhammad Yunus was awarded the Nobel Prize, for his concepts in Microcredit and Microfinance.", "World Council was founded on January 1, 1971, as the global trade association for credit unions. World Council has worked with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) to build Islamic Investment and Finance Cooperatives in Afghanistan.[2] In 2006, World Council received a $6.7 million grant from the Gates Foundation to develop credit unions in Africa and Latin America.[3]", "Ela Bhatt had initiated women's own SEWA Cooperative Bank in 1974 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, perhaps one of the first modern day microfinance institution of its kind. Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Prize winner, had introduced the concept of Micro-credit in Bangladesh in the form of the \"Grameen Bank\". The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) looked at several models for offering financial services to the unbanked, especially women, and decided to experiment with a very different model, now popularly known as Self-help Groups (SHGs). In this approach, a small group of women (and men) are able to form their own little mini bank, self-governed and managed, and create links with banks SHGs (Self-help groups), NGOs and banks. SHGs are often formed and nurtured by NGOs and only after accomplishing a certain level of maturity in terms of their internal thrift and credit operations, they are able to save, and also seek credit from the banks. There is often an involvement of an NGO, or a government agency during initial training and even after the SHG-Bank linkage. The SHG-Bank linkage programme, which has been in place since 1992 in India, has savings accounts with 7.9 million SHGs, with 4.6 million SHGs having outstanding loans, with approximately $2 billion in saving with banks, and $8.9 Billion is outstanding loans, making it one of the largest microfinance program of its kind in the world (March 2016). It involves commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and cooperative banks in its operations.", "Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh, but also in many other countries. Loans to poor people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty.", "In 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.", "During the 1980s the IMF and WB created loan packages for the majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa as they experienced economic crises.[1]", "Microloans, made famous by the Grameen Bank, is where small amounts of money are loaned to farmers or villages, mostly women, who can then obtain physical capital to increase their economic rewards. However, microlending has been criticized for making hyperprofits off the poor even from its founder, Muhammad Yunus,[234] and in India, Arundhati Roy asserts that some 250,000 debt-ridden farmers have been driven to suicide.[235][236][237]", "The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an international financial institution that offers investment, advisory, and asset-management services to encourage private-sector development in developing countries. The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. It was established in 1956, as the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, to advance economic development by investing in for-profit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development.[2][3][4] The IFC's stated aim is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and achieve better living standards by mobilizing financial resources for private enterprise, promoting accessible and competitive markets, supporting businesses and other private-sector entities, and creating jobs and delivering necessary services to those who are poverty stricken or otherwise vulnerable.[5]", "As a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957. The DLF largely financed infrastructure (such as railroads, highways, and power plants), factories, and agriculture with loans whose terms were relatively \"soft\" in the sense of charging interest rates lower than commercial levels and being repayable in local currency rather than U.S. dollars.[93] Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan.[94] Operationally, the DLF became administratively self-contained by 1959 after contracting for administrative support from ICA for its first two years.[95] Also, the Export-Import Bank's lending limit was raised in 1958 from $5 billion to $7 billion,[96] and the administration advocated in January 1959 an expanded \"food for peace\" program.[97]", "In 2002, Opportunity International developed and founded MicroEnsure, a microinsurance entity providing weather-indexed crop insurance, affordable health insurance, and protection against other risks. MicroEnsure was the world's first microinsurance intermediary and received a generous grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2008. MicroEnsure spun off from Opportunity as its own company, and in 2013 it became a for-profit social enterprise.[4]", "During the 1940s and 1950s, developing countries with the poorest incomes began realizing that they could no longer afford to borrow capital and needed more-favorable lending terms than offered by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).[10] At the onset of his inaugural term in 1949, then-President of the United States Harry S. Truman assembled an advisory group to suggest ways to accomplish his Point Four Program, of which a significant component was an effort to strengthen developing countries, especially those nearest to the Eastern Bloc, to dissuade them from aligning with other communist states. The advisory group recommended an international mechanism that would function somewhere in between providing strictly-loaned and strictly-granted funds.[11] The UN and United States government published reports expressing support for the creation of a multilateral, concessional lending program for the poorest developing countries.[10] However, the United States was largely unresponsive and ultimately distracted by its involvement in the Korean War and unconvinced that development needed greater financial stimulation.[11]", "In 1996, the G7 launched an initiative for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC).[18]", "Another source of information regarding the environment of microfinance is the Global Microscope on the Microfinance Business Environment,[33] prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Inter-American Development Bank, and others. The 2011 report contains information on the environment of microfinance in 55 countries among two categories, Regulatory Framework and the Supporting Institutional Framework.[34] This publication, also known as the Microscope, was first developed in 2007, focusing only on Latin America and the Caribbean, but by 2009, this report had become a global study.[35]", "In 2004, the Bush Administration created the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) as a new foreign aid agency to provide financial assistance to a limited number of countries selected for good performance in socioeconomic development.[122] The MCC also finances some USAID-administered development assistance projects.", "In December 1976, Yunus finally secured a loan from the government Janata Bank to lend to the poor in Jobra. The institution continued to operate, securing loans from other banks for its projects. By 1982, it had 28,000 members. On 1 October 1983, the pilot project began operation as a full-fledged bank for poor Bangladeshis and was renamed Grameen Bank (\"Village Bank\"). Yunus and his colleagues encountered everything from violent radical leftists to conservative clergy who told women that they would be denied a Muslim burial if they borrowed money from Grameen.[11] By July 2007, Grameen had issued US$6.38\u00a0billion to 7.4\u00a0million borrowers.[22] To ensure repayment, the bank uses a system of \"solidarity groups\". These small informal groups apply together for loans and its members act as co-guarantors of repayment and support one another's efforts at economic self-advancement.[15]", "When the Marshall Plan went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were earmarked for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the International Development Association was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.", "These factors incentivized the public and private supports to have microlending activity in the United States.[38]", "Prominent individuals associated with social entrepreneurship include Pakistani Akhter Hameed Khan and Bangladeshi Muhammad Yunus. Yunus was the founder of Grameen Bank, which pioneered the concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.[9] He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Others, such as former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith addressed social efforts on a local level by using the private sector to provide city services.[10][11]", "Finally, in September 1996, the joint proposal of the Development Committee of the World Bank and the IMF Interim Committee, the international financial community has recognized that the debt situation of a number of very poor countries, of which three quarters are located in sub-Saharan Africa remained extremely difficult, even after having used traditional mechanisms. A group of 39 countries,[12] were identified as being potentially eligible for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPCs.", "The principles of microcredit have also been applied in attempting to address several non-poverty-related issues.  Among these, multiple Internet-based organizations have developed platforms that facilitate a modified form of peer-to-peer lending where a loan is not made in the form of a single, direct loan, but as the aggregation of a number of smaller loans\u00e2\u20ac\u201doften at a negligible interest rate.", "Before 1974, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. Fiscal conservatism ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.[8]:56\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60", "In addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or innovative financing mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care,[12] such as micro-contributions, public-private partnerships, and market-based financial transaction taxes. For example, as of June 2011, UNITAID had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.[13]", "Developing countries grew increasingly frustrated with not being able to afford IBRD lending and perceived the Marshall Plan as a comparatively generous gift to European nations. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing countries began calling for the United Nations (UN) to create a development agency that would offer technical support and concessional financing, with a particular desire that the agency adhere to other UN bodies' convention of each country having one vote as opposed to a weighted vote. However, the United States ultimately opposed proposals of that nature. As the United States grew more concerned over the growth of the Cold War, it made a concession in 1954 at the behest of its Department of State by backing the conception of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Despite the launch of the IFC in 1956, developing countries persisted in demanding the creation of a new concessional financing mechanism and the idea gained traction within the IBRD.[11] Then-President of the IBRD Eugene R. Black, Sr. began circulating the notion of an International Development Association, as opposed to an idea of a concessional named the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED) governed by the United Nations.[12] Paul Hoffman, the Marshall Plan's former Administrator, proposed the idea of a soft-loan facility within the World Bank, where the US would have a preponderant voice in the allocation of such loans.Democratic Senator Mike Monroney of Oklahoma supported this idea.[12] As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International Finance, Monroney proposed a resolution recommending a study of the potential establishment of an International Development Association to be affiliated with the IBRD.[10] Monroney's proposal was more preferred received within the United States than the SUNFED.[11] The resolution passed the senate in 1958, and then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert B. Anderson encouraged other countries to conduct similar studies. In 1959, the World Bank's Board of Governors approved a U.S.-born resolution calling for the drafting of the articles of agreement.[10] SUNFED later became the Special Fund and merged with the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance to form the United Nations Development Programme.", "However, the recent spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has made genuine international person-to-person  philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.[120]", "According to technology analyst David Garrity, Microfinance and Mobile Financial Services (MFS) have provided marginal populations with access to basic financial services, including savings programs and insurance policies.[61]", "During the post second world war period and with the introduction of the Bretton Woods system in 1944, two organizations were created: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.[203] Encouraged by these institutions, commercial banks started to lend to sovereign states in the third world. This was at the same time as inflation started to rise in the west.

The Chiefs recovered and started their next drive at their own 48-yard line but failed to convert on third down and punted.

In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, as part of the sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.[12]", "The adrenal glands are located above the kidneys in humans and in front of the kidneys in other animals. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol.[2] It controls the behaviour during crisis and emotional situations. It stimulates the heart and its conducting tissues and metabolic processes.", "The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol.[1][2] They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.[3]", "The adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5\u00e2\u20ac\u201cT11.[20] Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion.[20] Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.", "The adrenal medulla is considered a sympathetic ganglion and, like other sympathetic ganglia, is supplied by cholinergic preganglionic sympathetic fibers: acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter utilized at this synapse. The chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla act as \"modified neurons\", releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline into the bloodstream as hormones instead of as neurotransmitters. The other postganglionic fibers of the peripheral autonomic system belong to the parasympathetic division; all are cholinergic fibers, and use acetycholine as the neurotransmitter.", "Adrenomedullary hormones are catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla by chromaffin cells, neurosecretory cells connected to the central nervous system.[10] The synthesis, storage (in chromaffin cells) and release of catecholamines is co-regulated by synaptic input from their respective pre-synaptic sympathetic neurons, as well as hormonal and local inputs.[11][12] The adrenomedullary hormones are:", "The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system.[44] Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.[45]", "Norepinephrine is the main neurotransmitter used by the sympathetic nervous system, which consists of about two dozen sympathetic chain ganglia located next to the spinal cord, plus a set of prevertebral ganglia located in the chest and abdomen.[13] These sympathetic ganglia are connected to numerous organs, including the eyes, salivary glands, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, stomach, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder, reproductive organs, muscles, skin, and adrenal glands.[13]  Sympathetic activation of the adrenal glands causes the part called the adrenal medulla to release norepinephrine (as well as epinephrine) into the bloodstream, from which, functioning as a hormone, it gains further access to a wide variety of tissues.[13]", "Catecholamine release is stimulated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.[33]", "The adrenal medulla is at the centre of each adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.[19]", "Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the sympathetic nervous system stimulate the synthesis of adrenaline precursors by enhancing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine \u00ce\u00b2-hydroxylase, two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis.[citation needed] ACTH also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis. This is most often done in response to stress.[citation needed] The sympathetic nervous system, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release of adrenaline. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and, thus, the release of adrenaline (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream.[74]", "The hypothalamus produces releasing hormones and neurohypophysial hormones in specialized hypothalamic neurons which extend to the median eminence and posterior pituitary. The adrenal medulla produces adrenomedullary hormones in chromaffin cells, cells which are very similar in structure to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons, even though they are not neurons they are derivatives of the neural crest.[4]", "Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the sympathetic nervous system stimulate the synthesis of adrenaline precursors by enhancing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine \u00ce\u00b2-hydroxylase, two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis.[citation needed] ACTH also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis.

Fibers from the SNS innervate tissues in almost every organ system, providing at least some regulation of functions as diverse as pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary system output and function.[12] It is perhaps best known for mediating the neuronal and hormonal stress response commonly known as the fight-or-flight response. This response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body, as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla (but also all other sympathetic fibers) secrete acetylcholine, which activates the great secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from it. Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.", "The sympathetic nervous system originates in the spinal cord and its main function is to activate the physiological changes that occur during the fight-or-flight response. This component of the autonomic nervous system utilises and activates the release of norepinephrine in the reaction.[8]", "The adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body. These hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions.[23]", "Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are innervated by the splanchnic nerve and secrete adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), some dopamine, enkephalin and enkephalin-containing peptides, and a few other hormones into the blood stream. The secreted adrenaline and noradrenaline play an important role in the sympathetic nervous system response, commonly called the fight-or-flight response. The enkephalins and enkephalin-containing peptides are related to, but distinct from endogenous peptides named endorphins (which are secreted from the pituitary); all of these peptides bind to opioid receptors and produce analgesic (and other) responses. The hormones are secreted from chromaffin granules; this is where the enzyme dopamine \u00ce\u00b2-hydroxylase catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline.[7] Distinct N and E cell forms exist (also Na and A cells in British nomenclature - noradrenaline and adrenaline); the former produce norepinephrine, the latter arise out of N cells through interaction with glucocorticoids, and convert norepinephrine into epinephrine.[8]", "The reaction begins in the amygdala, which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH.[9] The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone epinephrine. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone cortisol, which increases blood pressure, blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system.[10] The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to liver cells and the subsequent production of glucose.[11] Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn fatty acids into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.[12] Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action and\u00c2\u00a0:[13]", "The adrenal medulla consists of irregularly shaped cells grouped around blood vessels. These cells are intimately connected with the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In fact, these adrenal medullary cells are modified postganglionic neurons, and preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers lead to them directly from the central nervous system. The adrenal medulla therefore affects available energy, heart rate, and metabolism. Recent research indicates that the adrenal medulla is under the control of the sensory and motor cortex rather than centres associated with the conscious mind as previously thought.[1]", "It is produced in humans by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland.[1] It is released in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, to suppress the immune system, and to aid in the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates.[2] It also decreases bone formation.[3]", "Very few parts of the sympathetic system use cholinergic receptors. In sweat glands the receptors are of the muscarinic type. The sympathetic nervous system also has some preganglionic nerves terminating at the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, which secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into the bloodstream. Some believe that chromaffin cells are modified postganglionic CNS fibers. In the adrenal medulla, acetylcholine is used as a neurotransmitter, and the receptor is of the nicotinic type.", "The adrenal medulla (Latin: medulla glandulae suprarenalis) is part of the adrenal gland. It is located at the center of the gland, being surrounded by the adrenal cortex. It is the innermost part of the adrenal gland, consisting of cells that secrete epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and a small amount of dopamine in response to stimulation by sympathetic preganglionic neurons.", "Increased epinephrine secretion is observed in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction and to a lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased.[47][48][49] Therefore, there must be some autonomy of the adrenal medulla from the rest of the sympathetic system.", "Increased epinephrine secretion is observed in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction and to a lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor.

In adrenalectomized patients hemodynamic and metabolic responses to stimuli such as hypoglycemia and exercise remain normal.[24][25]", "At the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline (norepinephrine), along with other cotransmitters such as ATP, to act on adrenergic receptors, with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla:", "Cortisol is produced in the human body by the adrenal gland in the zona fasciculata,[1] the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. The cortex forms the outer \"bark\" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus, a part of the brain. The secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus[46] triggers cells in the neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete another hormone, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and dehydroepiandrosterone.", "The concept of the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic nervous system being involved in the flight, fight and fright response was originally proposed by Cannon.[22] But the adrenal medulla, in contrast to the adrenal cortex, is not required for survival. In adrenalectomized patients hemodynamic and metabolic responses to stimuli such as hypoglycemia and exercise remain normal.[23][24]", "The adrenal glands contribute about 7% of circulating norepinephrine, most of which is a spill over from neurotransmission with little activity as a hormone.[14][15][16]\nPharmacological doses of epinephrine stimulate \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23 adrenoceptors of the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic nerve receptors are classified as adrenergic, based on their responsiveness to adrenaline.[17]", "The brain endocrine interactions are relevant in the translation of stress into physiological and psychological changes. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), as mentioned above, plays an important role in translating stress into a response. The ANS responds reflexively to both physical stressors (for example baroreception), and to higher level inputs from the brain.[37] The ANS is composed of the parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system, two branches that are both tonically active with opposing activities. The ANS directly innervates tissue through the postganglionic nerves, which is controlled by preganglionic neurons originating in the intermediolateral cell column. The ANS receives inputs from the medulla, hypothalamus, limbic system, prefrontal cortex, midbrain and monoamine nuclei.[38] The activity of the sympathetic nervous system drives what sometimes called the \"fight or flight\" response. The fight or flight response to emergency or stress involves mydriasis, increased heart rate and force contraction, vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, sweating, decreased motility of the digestive system, secretion of the epinephrine and cortisol from the adrenal medulla, and relaxation of the bladder wall. The parasympathetic nervous response, \"rest and digest\", involves return to maintaining homeostasis, and involves miosis, bronchoconstriction, increased activity of the digestive system, and contraction of the bladder walls.[37] Complex relationships between protective and vulnerability factors on the effect of childhood home stress on psychological illness, cardiovascular illness and adaption have been observed.[39] ANS related mechanisms are thought to contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease after major stressful events[40]", "The adrenal medulla may be poorly formed or absent in cases of absent adrenal gland. The deficiency in circulating catecholamines is mildly symptomatic due to compensation by the autonomous nervous system, except in episodes of hypoglycemia where glycogenolysis cannot be stimulated by circulating epinephrine .[3]", "Because the ANS, specifically the sympathetic division, exerts direct control over the chromaffin cells the hormone release can occur rather quickly. In response to stressors such as exercise or imminent danger, medullary cells release the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline into the blood. Adrenaline composes about 85% of the released catecholamines, and noradrenaline the other 15%.[2]", "In the brain, norepinephrine is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the locus coeruleus, located in the pons. Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by sympathetic ganglia located near the spinal cord or in the abdomen, and it is also released directly into the bloodstream by the adrenal glands. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating noradrenergic receptors located on the cell surface.", "The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.[4] The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.[5] The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.[4]", "Sympathetic (adrenergic)", "Adrenaline, also known as adrenalin or epinephrine, is a hormone, neurotransmitter, and medication.[3][4] Epinephrine is normally produced by both the adrenal glands and certain neurons.[3] It plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation response, and blood sugar level.[5][6] It does this by binding to alpha and beta receptors.[6] It is found in many animals and some single cell organisms.[7][8] Napoleon Cybulski first isolated epinephrine in 1895.[9]", "Low, or absent, concentrations of epinephrine can be seen in autonomic neuropathy or following adrenalectomy. Failure of the adrenal cortex, as with Addisons disease, can suppress epinephrine secretion as the activity of the synthesing enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, depends on the high concentration of cortisol that drains from the cortex to the medulla.[55][56][57]", "Low, or absent, concentrations of epinephrine can be seen in autonomic neuropathy or following adrenalectomy.

Interruptions in the delivery of cholesterol include Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and abetalipoproteinemia.", "Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. (The name cortisol is derived from cortex.) While the adrenal cortex also produces aldosterone (in the zona glomerulosa) and some sex hormones (in the zona reticularis), cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species. (However, in cattle, corticosterone levels may approach[94] or exceed[4] cortisol levels.). The medulla of the adrenal gland lies under the cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation.", "Chromaffin cells, also pheochromocytes, are neuroendocrine cells found mostly in the medulla of the adrenal glands in mammals. These cells serve a variety of functions such as serving as a response to stress, monitoring carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the body, maintenance of respiration and the regulation of blood pressure.[1] They are in close proximity to pre-synaptic sympathetic ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system, with which they communicate, and structurally they are similar to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons. In order to activate chromaffin cells, the splanchnic nerve of the sympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine, which then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the adrenal medulla. This causes the release of catecholamines. The chromaffin cells release catecholamines: ~80% of Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and ~20% of Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine) into systemic circulation for systemic effects on multiple organs (similarly to secretory neurones of the hypothalamus), and can also send paracrine signals. Hence they are called neuroendocrine cells.", "As a cluster of neuron cell bodies, the adrenal medulla is considered a ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system.", "At a schematic level, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are both organized in essentially the same way: preganglionic neurons in the central nervous system send projections to neurons located in autonomic ganglia; these neurons then send output projections to virtually every tissue of the body. In both branches the internal connections\u2014the projections from the central nervous system to the autonomic ganglia\u2014use acetylcholine as neurotransmitter, and the receptors it activates are of the nicotinic type. In the parasympathetic nervous system the output connections\u2014the projections from ganglion neurons to tissues that don't belong to the nervous system\u2014also release acetylcholine, acting on muscarinic receptors. In the sympathetic nervous system the output connections mainly release noradrenaline, although acetylcholine is released at a few points, such as the sudomotor innervation of the sweat glands.", "Situated along the perimeter of the adrenal gland, the adrenal cortex mediates the stress response through the production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, such as aldosterone and cortisol, respectively. It is also a secondary site of androgen synthesis.[2] Recent data suggest that adrenocortical cells under pathological as well as under physiological conditions show neuroendocrine properties; within the normal adrenal, this neuroendocrine differentiation seems to be restricted to cells of the zona glomerulosa and might be important for an autocrine regulation of adrenocortical function.[3]", "Many cells possess these receptors, and the binding of a catecholamine to the receptor will generally stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, which includes dilating the pupil, increasing heart rate, mobilizing energy, and diverting blood flow from non-essential organs to skeletal muscle.", "A notable exception to the routes mentioned above is the sympathetic innervation of the suprarenal (adrenal) medulla. In this case, presynaptic neurons pass through paravertebral ganglia, on through prevertebral ganglia and then synapse directly with suprarenal tissue. This tissue consists of cells that have pseudo-neuron like qualities in that when activated by the presynaptic neuron, they will release their neurotransmitter (epinephrine) directly into the bloodstream."]}, {"query": "who was the oldest man elected president of usa", "similarities": [0.7706727981567383, 0.7639445066452026, 0.7597501277923584, 0.7586529850959778, 0.7487287521362305, 0.7388491630554199, 0.7382689714431763, 0.7346746921539307, 0.7336969971656799, 0.7253152132034302, 0.7252011299133301, 0.7202497720718384, 0.7166507840156555, 0.7095751762390137, 0.6998399496078491, 0.6992174983024597, 0.6949211359024048, 0.6944938898086548, 0.6940341591835022, 0.6922262907028198, 0.6922262907028198, 0.6922262907028198, 0.6922262907028198, 0.6892646551132202, 0.6889873743057251, 0.6884042024612427, 0.6871225833892822, 0.6852824091911316, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6833148002624512, 0.6830552816390991, 0.6828866004943848, 0.6815197467803955, 0.681304395198822, 0.6812949180603027, 0.6806575059890747, 0.6795825958251953, 0.6787536144256592, 0.6787536144256592, 0.6787536144256592, 0.6787536144256592, 0.6787536144256592, 0.6787536144256592, 0.6787536144256592], "hits": ["Both major-party candidates were unusually old.

An enraged Molly Weasley engages Bellatrix and fires a curse that hits Bellatrix right over the heart, killing her.[17] Rowling has stated that she had Molly kill Bellatrix to show Molly's great powers as a witch and to confront Molly's consumption with \"maternal love\" and Bellatrix's obsession with Voldemort.[18]", "Later in the novel, Ron and Harry transform themselves using Polyjuice Potion to resemble Draco Malfoy's close associates Crabbe and Goyle, so that they can spy on him, and find out what he knows about the Chamber of Secrets.

In the climax of the book, the Malfoys are brought with the other Death Eaters to Hogwarts, when Voldemort invades the castle. When Voldemort casts a Killing Curse on Harry, Narcissa is ordered to verify his death. When she feels Harry's heart beating, she quietly asks him whether Draco is still alive at Hogwarts, a fact that Harry confirms. Knowing that she will not be free to search for her son unless she can return with the Death Eaters as part of a \"conquering army\", Narcissa lies to Voldemort and declares Harry to be dead.

To keep Voldemort alive, Quirrell had to kill unicorns in the Forbidden Forest, drinking their blood to provide temporary life-sustaining powers for Voldemort. Quirrell then reveals that he was the one who let in the troll and attempted to throw Harry off his broom while Snape muttered a counter curse. During the climax of the story, as Harry and Quirrell try to recover the Stone from the Mirror of Erised, Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell's head, formerly concealed by the turban, and speaks directly to Harry, threatening to kill him if he does not assist Voldemort in recovering it. After Harry refuses, Quirrell tries to take the Stone by force. Voldemort orders Quirrell to attack Harry, who holds off Quirrell long enough for aid in the form of Dumbledore to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees, in his non-physical form. Voldemort's departure, as well as the agony suffered by him because of his contact with Harry, who continues to be protected by the love of his mother and the spell that was cast by her sacrificing her life to save Harry, causes Quirrell to die, hence Dumbledore's comment that Voldemort is as merciless to his followers as to his enemies.", "Pettigrew is portrayed by Timothy Spall as an adult, and by Charles Hughes as a teenager in the films.

Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a recording of a prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort, which is revealed to be the object Voldemort has been trying to obtain for the whole year, the Dark Lord believing that there was something he missed when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of the prophecies, in this case Harry or Voldemort, can safely remove them from the shelves. During a heated fight Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, enter a battle with the Death Eaters, during which Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius and Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him and climatically fights the Dark Lord to a stalemate.

To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.", "Near the end of the year, Harry and Dumbledore journey to a cave to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore expertly finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket is at the bottom of a basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden.

When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about the fact that it was Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher\u2019s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron\u2019s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.", "In the book's climax, Voldemort's second Killing Curse hurled at Harry also fails and rebounds upon Voldemort, finally killing him. The spell fails because Harry, not Voldemort, had become the Elder Wand's true master and the wand could not harm its own master. Harry has each of the Hallows (the Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand) at some point in the story but never unites them. However, J. K. Rowling said the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality, making him stronger than his nemesis. \"The real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living.\" At the very end, Harry decides to leave the Elder Wand in Dumbledore's tomb and the Resurrection Stone hidden in the forest, but he keeps the Invisibility Cloak because it had belonged to his father.[16]", "Towards the end of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school's defenders.

Harry first discovers this device in Goblet of Fire, and it is frequently used for flashback scenes throughout the remainder of the series. In the first chapter of Philosopher's Stone, Dumbledore is seen using the Deluminator, a device for removing and later returning light, and for use as a homing device. It is confirmed in Deathly Hallows when the object is inherited by Ron that the Deluminator is of Dumbledore's own design. Dumbledore is the possessor and master of the Elder Wand, an extremely powerful object known also as the \"Wand of Destiny\" or the \"Deathstick\", and one of the Deathly Hallows. Unlike many of the wand's previous owners, Dumbledore keeps its identity a closely guarded secret. He also has a pet phoenix named Fawkes. It is revealed in Philosopher's Stone by Mr. Ollivander that Harry's wand carries a phoenix feather as its magical core and that particular phoenix only gave one other feather, the one in Voldemort's wand that gave Harry his scar. It is later revealed in Goblet of Fire that Fawkes was the phoenix whose feathers provide the magical core in Harry's and Voldemort's wands.", "Bertha Jorkins was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as James Potter and company. She was known as nosy, with a good head for gossip. She became a Ministry of Magic employee after leaving Hogwarts. In the summer before the events of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, she was killed by Voldemort. Rowling later revealed that her death was used to turn Nagini, Voldemort's snake, into a Horcrux. Some months before her murder, she accidentally discovered that Barty Crouch Jr., who supposedly died in Azkaban prison, was still alive and being hidden by his father. Barty Crouch Sr. silenced her with a powerful Memory Charm, which made her a little befuddled. Voldemort irreparably damaged her mentally and physically while breaking the Memory Charm, through which he gained information about the Triwizard Tournament and Crouch Jr.. During the duel between Harry and Voldemort in the graveyard at Little Hangleton, Bertha is one of the shadows that spills out from Voldemort's wand and helps Harry escape.

The next day Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow with Albus Dumbledore's will and distributes three items to Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Ron receives Dumbledore's Deluminator, Hermione receives a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry receives the first Golden Snitch that he ever caught in a Quidditch match. Scrimgeour reveals that Harry was also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. The minister tells Harry that the sword was not Dumbledore's to bequeath, and in any case is missing.", "At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Molly and Arthur offer the Burrow as Order headquarters when Grimmauld Place is no longer safe.

As the novel progresses, the family is forced to head for safety at Auntie Muriel's home. At the end of the book, Molly and her entire family fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. She is devastated by the death of her son Fred and is pushed to the edge when Bellatrix Lestrange almost strikes Ginny with the Killing Curse. Enraged, she engages Bellatrix in an intense duel, killing her with a curse that hits her in the chest.[43] Rowling has stated that the reason she had Molly kill Bellatrix was to show Molly's great powers as a witch and to provide a contrast between Molly's consumption with \"maternal love\" and Bellatrix's with \"obsessive love\".[44]", "Arriving back in the wilderness, the trio sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to disguise his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating with a piece of broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby.

Death eater Alecto Carrow replaces McGonagall as deputy headmistress. Despite the many changes, she is retained as head of Gryffindor House. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, she goes to the Ravenclaw tower and finds Alecto stunned by Luna and Amycus Carrow searching for Harry. She's surprised when Amycus tells her Voldemort warned them Harry would try to break into the Ravenclaw Tower, proudly telling him Harry has no business on the Ravenclaw Tower, for Harry is in her House, Gryffindor. When Amycus suggests blaming the students to compensate for his sister's state, McGonagall immediately intervenes. In response, Amycus spits in her face. Harry, who is present and hidden under his invisibility cloak, reveals himself and uses the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus.  Harry then informs McGonagall that Voldemort is on his way and after tying up both the Carrows and placing them in a net, she sends three Patronuses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which manifest as a cat-to warn the other three Heads of House.[9] When on her way to meet the Heads of House, she meets Snape, who questions her about Harry's whereabouts. Not realising that Snape is a re-doubled agent acting for the good side and not knowing that he has important information for Harry, she attacks him, engaging in a fierce duel. With help from Professors Sprout and Flitwick, she succeeds in driving Snape away. McGonagall then takes charge of the school again and proceeds to secure it against Voldemort to ensure Harry can fulfil his mission from Dumbledore. She also organises the evacuation of the school's under-age students to ensure their safety. She then leads the remaining students, the staff of Hogwarts, and members of the Order of the Phoenix in the fight against Voldemort. She is seen during the battle with a large gash on her cheek and commanding a herd of charmed desks to charge at Death Eaters. When Harry has been apparently killed, she screams, causing Bellatrix Lestrange to laugh. Finally, McGonagall ends up duelling Voldemort alongside Kingsley Shacklebolt and Professor Slughorn. As is confirmed in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, McGonagall becomes Headmistress of Hogwarts after the Battle of Hogwarts and Snape's death; however, in an interview Rowling said McGonagall would be retired by the time of the Deathly Hallows epilogue (19 years after the main events of Deathly Hallows), as she is \"getting on in years\".", "In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 he is seen in Hogwarts Express and in Part 2 he is seen participating in the battle at Hogwarts, which he survives.", "By the end of the book, Dumbledore and Harry set out to the cave where Dumbledore believes a Horcrux resides.

When he does this though, all the Inferi that reside in the lake grab at Harry and attempt to drag him down and drown him in the lake. Dumbledore suddenly recovers, thanks to the water, and conjures a fire lasso around them. Dumbledore takes the horcrux (a locket) and both make their way back out of the cave and back to Hogsmeade. When they return, Madam Rosmerta informs them that the Dark Mark was conjured over the Astronomy Tower. In the tower, Dumbledore enjoins Harry not to interfere in the events that are about to take place there, and places him in a body-binding curse under his invisibility cloak. Hidden, Harry is unable to intervene as Dumbledore (now extremely weak) is disarmed by Draco. Dumbledore is conversing with Draco about the plot to kill him, when several other Death Eaters enter the tower and try to persuade Draco to kill Dumbledore.

Voldemort also borrows Lucius's wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest. Despite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort's advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius has decided his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war.

It was a dying Rowena Ravenclaw's wish to see her daughter again, and so she sent for the Bloody Baron to look for her, knowing that he would not rest until he brought her back, partly because he was in love with her. However, she refused to come with the Baron and, in a moment of blind rage, he killed her with a single stab-wound to the chest. Overcome with remorse, the Bloody Baron killed himself using the same weapon in turn and wears chains as penitence, \"as he should\", the Grey Lady says. The diadem remained in the hollow of a tree in an Albanian forest until Tom Riddle managed to charm the story out of the Grey Lady. Riddle, who had been seeking historically significant objects to make into Horcruxes, later retrieved the diadem from Albania and hid it in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts while visiting the castle years later.", "Draco, in an arrogant attempt to show up his school nemesis, endeavours to approach Buckbeak as well. It becomes obvious that Draco neither listens to nor cares about Hagrid's warnings about the hippogriffs' sensitivity, as he makes contemptuous remarks about Buckbeak. Quickly angered, Buckbeak slashes Draco\u2019s arm with his claws. Pretending to be injured much more severely than he truly is, Draco persuades his father, Lucius Malfoy, to use his political power to sentence Buckbeak to death. Hagrid\u2019s numerous appeals fail, and members of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures come to Hogwarts to execute Buckbeak. With the use of a Time-Turner, Hermione and Harry free Buckbeak (they believed him earlier to have been executed, but it was revealed the executioner only swung his axe into the fence in anger, in the film he does this to a pumpkin) and rescue Sirius from the tower in which he is being held before being handed over to the Dementors.

Harry learns that Dumbledore made a terrible error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use to allow him to apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, all he could do was contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.", "At the well, Pan (who still occupies Henry's body) and Felix are talking about casting the Curse, as Pan drops the ingredients he took from Regina's vault in the well. He takes the final element needed to enact it, which was Felix's heart, because of his loyalty to Pan. Pan rips out Felix's heart, crushes it, and drops the ashes into the well. Back at the Vault, Gold explains that the only person who can stop it is Regina, but she will need the scroll to do it and since she was the one who enacted it in the first place, Regina is only one who can destroy the scroll. However, Gold warns Regina there will be a price. Gold also tells the others that he may be able to switch Henry and Pan's bodies back, but he needs the one thing that will reverse it, which is the wand of the Black Fairy. As everyone involved begins the search, Snow talks to Emma, lamenting that she never got to raise her daughter, while at the church (where the other fairies/nuns are gathering for Mother Superior's wake), David, Tinker Bell, Hook, and Neal are looking for the wand, unaware that another individual is also looking for it as well: Pan's Shadow. Hook spots the Shadow but fails to stop it, prompting Tinker Bell to come to his aid by using some of her Pixie Dust to fly up to the Shadow, trapping and throwing it into a nearby fire, apparently killing it. Her actions also bring Mother Superior, whose shadow was taken by Pan's Shadow, back to life. She restores Tinker Bell as a real fairy and gives them the Black Fairy's wand.", "Harry decides he wants someone to wear the Horcrux at all times, fearing it might be lost or stolen. This has a much more profound effect on Ron than it seems to have on Hermione or Harry. Ron ends up lashing out in frustration at the lack of comforts and a concrete plan, eventually leaving his friends behind. Distressed over his absence, Harry and Hermione do not even mention his name during the time that he is gone. However, when they finally mention his name, Ron, who had immediately regretted his decision to leave but was captured by Snatchers and then could not return due to Hermione's anti-Death Eater enchantments, was led to Harry's location by unknown magic within the Deluminator he inherited from Dumbledore. Ron dramatically returns by saving Harry from drowning when Harry is attempting to recover Godric Gryffindor's sword from an icy pool. Harry, a sudden believer in the fate created by his return, immediately forgives Ron and insists it must be Ron who uses the sword to destroy Slytherin's locket. However, the portion of Voldemort's soul inside it plays on Ron's insecurities by revealing that Ron thinks he is \"least loved by a mother who craved a daughter\", then showing him a doppelg\u00e4nger of Harry who tells him that Harry was happier without him and a doppelg\u00e4nger of Hermione who does not return his affections and is involved instead with Harry.

While Simon distracts the goblins, Mallory and Jared manage to reach a tunnel under the estate. They are pursued by a mole troll and only narrowly escape it when it is struck by an oncoming vehicle. Lucinda tells them that they need to find Arthur Spiderwick and have him destroy the book. However, Arthur is being held captive by Sylphs, a type of fairie. Suddenly, Mulgarath's goblins attack them and steal several pages from the book before they are driven off. In the woods, Mulgarath violently berates Redcap for not bringing all of the book, as most of the information in the stolen pages were useless, but he is pleased by when he discovers that one of them has information that tells them how to break the protective circle by moonrise. Mulgarath and Redcap prepare to make the potion for the upcoming night. Meanwhile, Helen, who drives Jared and Mallory home, doesn't believe them on what's going on and accuses them of using that as an excuse for wanting to go back to New York. Jared then gets in a heated argument with her on why his father left her because of her not listening and starts yelling. Once home, Jared tells Helen he hates her and doesn't want to live with her. Later, Hogsqueal warns Jared, Simon, and Mallory about Mulgarath's plan and gives Simon and Mallory the ability to see fairies.

Laemmle read the book in one night and bought the film rights as a vehicle for actor Lon Chaney, Sr..[3] Production started in late 1924 at Universal Studios and did not go smoothly. According to the director of photography, Charles Van Enger, throughout the production Chaney and the rest of the cast and crew had strained relations with director Rupert Julian. The first cut of the film was previewed in Los Angeles on January 7 and 26, 1925. The score was prepared by Joseph Carl Breil. No information about the score survives other than Universal's release: \"Presented with augmented concert orchestra, playing the score composed by J. Carl Briel, composer of music for Birth of a Nation\". The exact quote from the opening day full-page ad in the Call-Bulletin read: \"Universal Weekly claimed a 60-piece orchestra. Moving Picture World reported that \"The music from Faust supplied the music [for the picture].\" Due to poor reviews and reactions, the January release was canceled. On advice from Chaney and others, Universal told Julian to re-shoot most of the picture and change its style, as it was feared that a Gothic melodrama would not recoup the film's massive budget. Julian eventually walked out.", "'The famous Think of Me is classical opera song from the musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\".

Sullivan's authorship of the overture to Utopia, Limited cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, but it is likely attributable to him, as it consists of only a few bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). Thespis is now lost, but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture.[163] Very early performances of The Sorcerer used a section of Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's Henry the VIII, as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke.[164]  Of those remaining, the overtures to H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are by Alfred Cellier,[165] the overture to Patience is by Eugene d'Albert,[166] and those to The Mikado and Ruddigore are by Hamilton Clarke (although the Ruddigore overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).[167]", "On January 10, 2012, Shadowland Productions released The Phantom of the Opera: Angel of Music Edition, a two-disc DVD set featuring a newly recorded dialogue track with sound effects and an original musical score.

What he did not want, and what happened, was that the trial became a circus. First, the two attorneys appointed to represent the two Kiowa actually represented them, instead of participating in the kind of civics lesson which the Army had wanted. Their trial strategy of arguing that the two Chiefs were simply fighting a war for their people's survival attracted worldwide attention, and galvanized opposition to the entire process. Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs also opted to oppose the entire process, and also argued that the two chiefs were not subject to civilian jurisdiction since their people were at war with the United States. Nor were the Indians apologetic. At his trail Satanta warned what might happen if he was hanged: \" I am a great chief among my people. If you kill me, it will be like a spark on the prairie. It will make a big fire \u2013 a terrible fire!\" Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, as was Big Tree; but Edmund Davis, the Governor of Texas, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment for both was changed to life imprisonment. Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5\u20136 July in Jack County, Texas.

Holding it was crucial if Maxentius was to keep his rival out of Rome, where the Senate would surely favour whoever held the city. As Maxentius had probably partially destroyed the bridge during his preparations for a siege, he had a wooden or pontoon bridge constructed to get his army across the river. The sources vary as to the nature of the bridge central to the events of the battle. Zosimus mentions it, vaguely, as being constructed in two parts connected by iron fastenings, while others indicate that it was a pontoon bridge; sources are also unclear as to whether the bridge was deliberately constructed as a collapsible trap for Constantine's forces or not.[16]", "The largest rivers to be spanned by solid bridges by the Romans were the Danube and the Rhine, the two largest European rivers west of the Eurasian Steppe. The lower Danube was crossed by least two (Trajan's Bridge, Constantine's Bridge) and the middle and lower Rhine by four different bridges (Roman Bridge at Mainz, Caesar's Rhine bridges, Roman Bridge at Koblenz, Roman Bridge at Cologne). For rivers with strong currents and to allow swift army movements, pontoon bridges were also routinely employed.[16] Going from the distinct lack of records of pre-modern solid bridges spanning larger rivers,[17] the Roman feat appears to be unsurpassed anywhere in the world until into the 19th century.", "The Tiber was also believed to be the river into which Romulus and Remus (the former founded Rome) were thrown as infants.", "The city of Rome grew from settlements around a ford on the river Tiber, a crossroads of traffic and trade.[15] According to archaeological evidence, the village of Rome was probably founded some time in the 8th century BC, though it may go back as far as the 10th century BC, by members of the Latin tribe of Italy, on the top of the Palatine Hill.[19][20]", "The Seven Hills of Rome (Italian: Sette colli di Roma [\u02c8s\u025btte \u02c8k\u0254lli di \u02c8ro\u02d0ma], Latin: Septem colles/ montes Romae) east of the river Tiber form the geographical heart of Rome, within the walls of the city.", "Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; Mesopotamia, the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers Tigris and Euphrates; the ancient society of the Egyptians depended entirely upon the Nile.

The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The early years of the Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on gold reserves in the United Kingdom to such a degree that the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931.

In 1949, sterling was devalued and Canada followed, returning to a peg of C$1.10 = US$1.00. However, Canada allowed its dollar to float in 1950, whereupon the currency rose to a slight premium over the U.S. dollar for the next decade. But the Canadian dollar fell sharply after 1960 before it was again pegged in 1962 at C$1.00 = US$0.925.

The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a depreciation of the\u00a0dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced to raise interest rates in order to protect the gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.[11][12]", "On 15 August 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency.[4] This action, referred to as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the US dollar became a reserve currency used by many states.

Rising government spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline. Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold, gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon, resulting in the \"Nixon shock\".[69]", "Eventually, the United States chose to devalue the dollar. During the early 1960s American officials largely prevented the conversion of dollars to gold with a series of \"gentlemanly\" agreements and other policies \u2013 which included the London Gold Pool - but these actions were not sustainable; the danger of a run on U.S. gold reserves was too high.[23] With Nixon's election in 1968, American officials became increasingly concerned until Nixon finally issued Executive Order 11615 in August 1971, ending the direct convertibility of dollars to gold. He said, \"We must protect the position of the American dollar as pillar of monetary stability around the world\u2026 I am determined that the American dollar must never again be hostage in the hands of the international speculators.\"[24] This became known as the Nixon Shock and marked the dollar's transition from the gold standard to a fiat currency.", "From 1946 to the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods system made fixed currencies the norm; however, in 1971, the US decided no longer to uphold the dollar exchange at 1/35th of an ounce of gold, so that the currency was no longer fixed. After the 1973 Smithsonian Agreement, most of the world's currencies followed suit. However, some countries, such as most of the Gulf States, fixed their currency to the value of another currency, which has been more recently associated with slower rates of growth. When a currency floats, targets other than the exchange rate itself are used to administer monetary policy (see open-market operations).", "Following the return to the gold standard, British and United States gold coins, government of Canada notes, and Canadian coins were legal tender. Bank notes ceased to be legal tender. However, the return was short-lived. Britain went off the gold standard in September 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression. Canada followed suit by prohibiting export of gold on October 31, 1931, unofficially taking Canada off the gold standard. A year and a half later, the federal government ended the convertability of government notes for gold. It was expected to be a temporary measure until the world economic situation improved, but Canada has never returned to the gold standard.[78]", "The Fort Knox gold repository long maintained by the United States, functioned as a theoretical backing for federally issued \"gold certificates\" to substitute for the gold. Between 1933 and 1970 (when the U.S. officially left the gold standard), one U.S. dollar was technically worth exactly 1/35 of a troy ounce (889\u00c2\u00a0mg) of gold. However, actual trade in gold bullion as a precious metal within the United States was banned after 1933, with the explicit purpose of preventing the \"hoarding\" of private gold during an economic depression period in which maximal circulation of money was desired by influential economists. This was a fairly typical transition from commodity to representative to fiat money, with people trading in other goods being forced to trade in gold, then to receive paper money that purported to be as good as gold.", "In the Bretton Woods system put in place in 1944, US dollars were convertible to gold. In France, it was called \"America's exorbitant privilege\"[217] as it resulted in an \"asymmetric financial system\" where foreigners \"see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals\". As American economist Barry Eichengreen summarized: \"It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one\".[217] In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its US dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate. He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing US gold stock and US economic influence, it led US President Richard Nixon to unilaterally end the convertibility of the dollar to gold on 15 August 1971 (the \"Nixon Shock\"). This was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating fiat money and in October 1976, the US government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.[218][219]", "By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed Gresham's Law: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971.", "President Nixon cancelled the fixed-rate convertibility of US dollars to gold in 1971. In the absence of fixed value convertibility to gold, compared to other currencies, the US dollar subsequently deteriorated in value for several years, making fixed USD to local currency exchange rates unsustainable for most countries.[8]", "The earliest establishment of a gold standard was in the United Kingdom in 1821 followed by Australia in 1852 and Canada in 1853. Under this system, the external value of all currencies was denominated in terms of gold with central banks ready to buy and sell unlimited quantities of gold at the fixed price. Each central bank maintained gold reserves as their official reserve asset.[7] For example, during the \u201cclassical\u201d gold standard period (1879\u20131914), the U.S. dollar was defined as 0.048 troy oz. of pure gold.[8]", "By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed Gresham's law: keeping the gold and silver they received, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971, an action known as the Nixon shock. No country has an enforceable gold standard or silver standard currency system.", "Many other countries followed Britain in returning to the gold standard, this was followed by a period of relative stability but also deflation.[25] This state of affairs lasted until the Great Depression (1929\u20131939) forced countries off the gold standard. In September 19, 1931, speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain to abandon the gold standard. Loans from American and French Central Banks of \u00a350,000,000 were insufficient and exhausted in a matter of weeks, due to large gold outflows across the Atlantic.[26][27][28] The British benefited from this departure. They could now use monetary policy to stimulate the economy. Australia and New Zealand had already left the standard and Canada quickly followed suit.", "The British colony of Hong Kong would be the last, along with China, to abandon the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence (1s 3d) sterling.", "In 1971 the US devalued its dollar relative to gold, leading New Zealand on 23 December to peg its dollar at US$1.216 with a 4.5% fluctuation range, keeping the same gold value. From 9 July 1973 to 4 March 1985 the dollar's value was determined from a trade-weighted basket of currencies.", "The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign.[69] Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.[62]", "The gold standard or gold exchange standard of fixed exchange rates prevailed from about 1870 to 1914, before which many countries followed bimetallism.[3] The period between the two world wars was transitory, with the Bretton Woods system emerging as the new fixed exchange rate regime in the aftermath of World War II. It was formed with an intent to rebuild war-ravaged nations after World War II through a series of currency stabilization programs and infrastructure loans.[4] The early 1970s saw the breakdown of the system and its replacement by a mixture of fluctuating and fixed exchange rates.[5]", "This was meant to be a temporary measure, with the gold price of the dollar and the official rate of exchanges remaining constant. Revaluing currencies was the main purpose of this plan. No official revaluation or redemption occurred. The dollar subsequently floated. In December 1971, the \"Smithsonian Agreement\" was reached. In this agreement, the dollar was devalued from $35 per troy ounce of gold to $38. Other countries' currencies appreciated. However, gold convertibility did not resume. In October 1973, the price was raised to $42.22. Once again, the devaluation was insufficient. Within two weeks of the second devaluation the dollar was left to float. The $42.22 par value was made official in September 1973, long after it had been abandoned in practice. In October 1976, the government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes. From this point, the international monetary system was made of pure fiat money.", "The sudden jump in the price of gold after the demise of the Bretton Woods accords was a result of the significant prior debasement of the US dollar due to excessive inflation of the monetary supply via central bank (Federal Reserve) coordinated fractional reserve banking under the Bretton Woods partial gold standard. In the absence of an international mechanism tying the dollar to gold via fixed exchange rates, the dollar became a pure fiat currency and as such fell to its free market exchange price versus gold. Consequently, the price of gold rose from $35 per troy ounce (1.125 $/g) in 1969 to almost $500 (29 $/g) in 1980.", "By acts of Congress in 1933, including the Gold Reserve Act and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time. The Treasury Department was re-empowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion, thereby divorcing the domestic economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard, although international settlements were still in gold.[6]", "In March and April in a series of laws and executive orders, the government suspended the gold standard. Roosevelt stopped the outflow of gold by forbidding the export of gold except under license from the Treasury. Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of US dollars. The Treasury no longer paid out gold in exchange for dollars, and gold would no longer be considered valid legal tender for debts in private and public contracts.[49]", "The gold standard was suspended twice during World War I, once fully and then for foreign exchange. At the onset of the war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the gold standard was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange value of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.[11]", "If we contrast the 1930s with the Crash of 2008 where gold went through the roof, it is clear that the U.S. dollar on the gold standard was a completely different animal in comparison to the fiat free-floating U.S. dollar currency we have today. Both currencies in 1929 and 2008 were the U.S. dollar, but in an analogous way it is as if one was a Saber-toothed tiger and the other is a Bengal tiger; they are two completely different animals. Where we have experienced inflation since the Crash of 2008, the situation was much different in the 1930s when deflation set in. Unlike the deflation of the early 1930s, the U.S. economy currently appears to be in a \"liquidity trap,\" or a situation where monetary policy is unable to stimulate an economy back to health.\n\nIn terms of the stock market, nearly three years after the 1929 crash, the DJIA dropped 8.4% on August 12, 1932. Where we have experienced great volatility with large intraday swings in the past two months, in 2011, we have not experienced any record-shattering daily percentage drops to the tune of the 1930s. Where many of us may have that '30s feeling, in light of the DJIA, the CPI, and the national unemployment rate, we are simply not living in the '30s. Some individuals may feel as if we are living in a depression, but for many others the current global financial crisis simply does not feel like a depression akin to the 1930s.[182]", "In 1910, the federal government introduced a national currency, the Australian pound, which it pegged to the pound sterling. In effect, Australia was on the gold standard through the British peg. In 1914, Britain removed the pound sterling from the gold standard, creating inflation pressures. Britain returned the pound sterling to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-1913 parity, effectively revaluing both currencies significantly and unleashing crushing deflationary pressures and falling export demand. This had the immediate effect of making British and Australian exports far less competitive in non-British markets, and affected Australia's terms of trade.", "A negative balance of payments, growing public debt incurred by the Vietnam War and Great Society programs, and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued.[41] The drain on US gold reserves culminated with the London Gold Pool collapse in March 1968.[42] By 1970, the U.S. had seen its gold coverage deteriorate from 55% to 22%. This, in the view of neoclassical economists, represented the point where holders of the dollar had lost faith in the ability of the U.S. to cut budget and trade deficits.", "While there were numerous bank failures during the Great Depression, most banks in developed countries survived, as did most currencies and governments. The most significant monetary change during the depression was the demise of the gold standard by most nations that were on it. In the U.S., the dollar was redeemable in gold until 1933 when U.S. citizens were forced to turn over their gold (except for 5 ounces) for fiat currency (See: Executive Order 6102) and were forbidden to own monetary gold for the next four decades. Subsequently, gold was revalued from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce. U.S. dollars remained redeemable in gold by foreigners until 1971. Gold ownership was legalized in the U.S. in 1974, but not with legal tender status.", "Finally, President Richard Nixon announced[7] that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards. This announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the \"Nixon Shock\".", "Series 1934 gold certificates ($100, $1,000, $10,000 and $100,000) were issued after the gold standard was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9, 1933 (see United States Executive Order 6102). Thus the series 1934 notes were used only for intragovernmental (i.e., Federal Reserve Bank) transactions and were not issued to the public. This series was discontinued in 1940. The series 1928 gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green. See history of the United States dollar.", "The gold exchange standard was suspended February 8, 1932. Exchange controls were adopted April 30 and the official rate was fixed at 5.95 (buying) per US dollar. After the price of silver rose above the nominal value of most silver coins in the 1930s, Ecuador embargoed the export of silver (May 17, 1935). This was followed by numerous adjustments to the foreign exchange system as the sucre continued to depreciate. Foreign exchange controls were finally lifted in September 1937 and the official rate was set at 13.50 per US dollar. The sucre was devalued to 14.77 per dollar on June 4, 1940, and exchange controls were reimposed. The official rate became 14.00 per in 1942 and 13.50 per in 1944.", "In 1966, when the dollar was introduced, the international currency relationships were maintained under the Bretton Woods system, a fixed exchange rate system using a U.S. dollar standard. The Australian dollar, however, was effectively pegged to the British pound at an equivalent value of approximately 1\u00c2\u00a0gram of gold.", "From 1944 to 1971, the Bretton Woods agreement fixed the value of 35 United States dollars to one troy ounce of gold.[26]  Other currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar at fixed rates. The U.S. promised to redeem dollars in gold to other central banks. Trade imbalances were corrected by gold reserve exchanges or by loans from the International Monetary Fund.", "In 1873, during a decline in the value of silver\u2014exacerbated by the end of the German Empire's production of the thaler coins from which the dollar got its name\u2014the US government passed the Coinage Act of 1873 in April of that year. This essentially ended the bimetallic standard of the US, forcing it for the first time onto a pure gold standard. This measure, referred to by its opponents as \"the Crime of 1873\" and the topic of William Jennings Bryan's Cross of Gold speech in 1896, forced a contraction of the money supply in the US. It also drove down silver prices further, even as new silver mines were being established in Nevada, which stimulated mining investment but increased supply as demand was falling.[12] Silver miners arrived at US mints, unaware of the ban on production of silver coins, only to find their product no longer welcome there. By September, the US economy was in a crisis, deflation causing banking panics and destabilizing business investment, climaxing in the Panic of 1873."]}, {"query": "where did the smashing pumpkins get their name", "similarities": [0.8043277263641357, 0.8043277263641357, 0.7613981366157532, 0.7190127968788147, 0.7186572551727295, 0.7169995307922363, 0.7028101682662964, 0.6977027058601379, 0.6957125067710876, 0.6943255662918091, 0.6914142966270447, 0.6892958879470825, 0.6889296174049377, 0.6886468529701233, 0.6855075359344482, 0.6845391392707825, 0.6842964291572571, 0.6837162375450134, 0.6813568472862244, 0.6774709224700928, 0.6758884191513062, 0.6755034327507019, 0.6746855974197388, 0.6746078133583069, 0.6745931506156921, 0.6727316379547119, 0.6721977591514587, 0.6720731854438782, 0.6720448136329651, 0.6720082759857178, 0.6719663739204407, 0.6716505885124207, 0.6710373163223267, 0.670515239238739, 0.6698886752128601, 0.6696892976760864, 0.6682522296905518, 0.6665385365486145, 0.6665122509002686, 0.6659401655197144, 0.6649984121322632, 0.6643465757369995, 0.664187490940094, 0.6638835072517395, 0.6615456938743591, 0.661541223526001, 0.6608425378799438, 0.6591707468032837, 0.6590851545333862, 0.6589516401290894], "hits": ["The Smashing Pumpkins", "The Smashing Pumpkins", "The Smashing Pumpkins[1] are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988. Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar), the band included D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums) in its original incarnation. It has undergone many line-up changes over the course of its existence, with the current lineup being Corgan and rhythm guitarist Jeff Schroeder.", "The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 20\u00c2\u00a0million albums sold in the United States alone,[5][6] The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.", "Upon his return to Chicago, Corgan had already devised his next project \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a band that would be called The Smashing Pumpkins.[15] Corgan met guitarist James Iha while working in a record store, and the two began recording demos, which Corgan describes as \"gloomy little goth-pop records.\"[15] He then met bassist D'arcy Wretzky after a local show, arguing with her about a band that had just played, The Dan Reed Network. Soon after, the Smashing Pumpkins were formed.[16] The trio began to play together at local clubs with only a drum machine for percussion. To secure a show at the Metro in Chicago, the band recruited drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, and played for the first time as a quartet on October 5, 1988.", "The word pumpkin originates from the word pepon (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd), which is Greek for \"large melon\", something round and large.[3] The French adapted this word to pompon, which the British changed to pumpion and to the later American colonists became known as pumpkin.[4]", "In 1996, the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of Mellon Collie. Corgan's look during this period\u2014a shaved head, a longsleeve black shirt with the word \"Zero\" printed on it, and silver pants\u2014became iconic.[39] That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons, \"Homerpalooza\". With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and \"Zero\" shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time.[40][41] But the year was far from entirely positive for the band. In May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band's repeated requests for moshing to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O'Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her.[42] However, while Corgan maintained that moshing's \"time [had] come and gone\", the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.[43]", "In 1989, the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, \"I Am One\", in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, \"Tristessa\", on Sub Pop, after which they signed to Caroline Records.[15] The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin for $20,000.[16] In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction.[17] Gish became a minor success, with the single \"Rhinoceros\" receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline.[15] The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression,[18] writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.[19]", "The band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident.[44] The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation.[9] Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he'd \"gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe.\" But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, \"For nine years we have battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We wish [him] the best we have to offer\".[45] Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of Mellon Collie stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record,[46] and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, \"The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music.\"[47]", "The Pumpkins drew inspiration from a variety of other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist.[46][126] When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that \"Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal\" and that they \"were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt\". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East.[46] The song \"Zero\", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed \"cybermetal.\"[127] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them.[128] Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, \"In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do.\"[129] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as \"the Pumpkin chord\" (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for \"Cherub Rock\", \"Drown\", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix.[120] Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, The Stooges, and Blue Cheer.[130]", "Another fan died at a Smashing Pumpkins concert in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on September 24, 2007. The 20-year-old male was dragged out of the mosh pit, unconscious, to be pronounced dead at a hospital after first-aid specialists attempted to save him.[16][17][18]", "With the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, \"We've graduated now from 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana', now we're 'the next Pearl Jam'.\"[20]", "The Smashing Pumpkins' distinctive sound up until Adore involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process, a tactic that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness coproducer Flood called the \"Pumpkin guitar overdub army.\"[46] Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on Gish, Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with Siamese Dream; Corgan has stated that \"Soma\" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts.[120] While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\"[121] This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists & bands such as: David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra,[120] as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.[122]", "William Patrick Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967)[1] is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and professional wrestling magnate. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album TheFutureEmbrace in 2005 and a collection of poetry (Blinking with Fists) before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins.", "In April 2007, Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion.[72][73] Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \"didn't want to be a part of\" the reunion.[74] The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton.[75] That same month, \"Tarantula\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.[76]", "The Smashing Pumpkins played parts of \"Shine\" during their 2010 tour.[7] Billy Corgan has expressed his hatred of the song and noted its similarities to the Smashing Pumpkins' song Drown.[7] Corgan lost a lawsuit in the mid-1990s to Ed Roland after Roland was able to produce a demo tape featuring \"Shine\" that preceded the Smashing Pumpkins' release.[citation needed]", "After the breakup of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins.[7][8] While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order.[9] The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar[10] with a drum machine.[11] Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub.[12][13] After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer.[14]", "The name of Florence and the Machine is attributed to Florence Welch's teenage collaboration with Isabella \"Machine\" Summers. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, \"The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad.\"[19][20]", "Gallagher explained in an interview with Jonathan Ross on The Jonathan Ross Show that the inspiration for the band's name was from two sources. The idea to prefix the name with \"Noel Gallagher's\" was formed whilst washing up dishes listening to the album Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, while the latter part of the name is taken from the song \"High Flying Bird\" recorded by Jefferson Airplane among others.[1]", "The Smashing Pumpkins also released a cover of the song in their Live Smashing Pumpkins album series.", "In the 1990s, the Chicago-based band The Smashing Pumpkins emerged and went on to become one of the most successful alternative rock artists of the decade. Also in the 1990s, the Midwest was at the center of the emerging Midwest emo movement, with bands like The Get Up Kids (Missouri), Cursive (Nebraska) and Cap'n Jazz (Illinois) blending earlier hardcore punk sounds with a more melodic indie rock sentiment. This hybrid of styles came to be known as Midwest emo. Chicago-based artists Fall Out Boy and Plain White T's popularized the genre in the early part of the 21st century.[citation needed]", "The Smashing Pumpkins released a music video for their 1995 single, \"Tonight, Tonight\", highly inspired by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's film A Trip to the Moon.

In an A.P. profile that was published about the Smashing Pumpkins, guitarist James Iha and bass guitarist D'arcy Wretzky informed the writer that Billy Corgan played all of the instruments on the band's recordings. According to Corgan, this represented \"a cataclysmic moment\" in the band's history. Although this peeved other members of the band, they held together and continued onward.

It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, Scotland and Siberia and is now roughly situated in the Arctic around the current North Pole.", "The province's oil and natural gas furnish raw materials for large industrial complexes at Edmonton and Calgary, as well as for smaller ones at Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. These complexes include oil and gas refineries and plants that use refinery by-products to make plastics, chemicals, and fertilizer. The oil and gas industry provides a market for firms supplying pipes, drills, and other equipment. Large amounts of sulfur are extracted from natural gas in plants near the gas fields. Helium is extracted from the gas in a plant near Edson, west of Edmonton.", "The Canadian Shield is a collage of Archean plates and accreted juvenile arc terranes and sedimentary basins of the Proterozoic Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45 to 1.24 Ga, with the most substantial growth period occurring during the Trans-Hudson orogeny, between ca. 1.90 to 1.80 Ga.[6] The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The metamorphic base rocks are mostly from the Precambrian Supereon (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago), and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief 300 to 610\u00a0m (980 to 2,000\u00a0ft) above sea level with a few monadnocks and low mountain ranges (including the Torngat and Laurentian Mountains) probably eroded from the plateau during the Cenozoic Era. During the Pleistocene Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (see Hudson Bay), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil.", "Metals and Minerals industries", "The provincial economy is dominated by the seasonal industries of agriculture, tourism, and the fishery. The province is limited in terms of heavy industry and manufacturing, though Cavendish Farms runs extensive food manufacturing operations on PEI.", "Common shield construction types include:", "The northeastern part of Alberta, northern parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, as well as most of Labrador (the mainland portions of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador), are located on a vast rock base known as the Canadian Shield. The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important rivers used for hydroelectric production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The shield also encloses an area of wetlands, the Hudson Bay lowlands. Some particular regions of the Shield are referred to as mountain ranges, including the Torngat and Laurentian Mountains.[37]", "Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the primary sector, with the logging and oil industries being two of Canada's most important. Canada also has a sizable manufacturing sector, based in Central Canada, with the automobile industry and aircraft industry being especially important. With the world's longest coastline, Canada has the 8th largest commercial fishing and seafood industry in the world.[27][28] Canada is one of the global leaders of the entertainment software industry.[29] It is a member of the APEC, NAFTA, G7, G20, OECD and WTO.", "Other major manufacturing industries, grew along the Lachine Canal (1825), including Redpath Sugar, Darling and Brady, soap manufacturers, the St. Lawrence Glass Company, the Canadian Rubber Company, Laing Packing and Provisions (1852) and Belding Paul & Co. silk manufacturers provided consumer and industrial goods. The Imperial Tobacco Company (1912) became Canada's largest manufacturer of cigarettes. Morgans, Canada's first department store, opened its doors in 1845. The Montreal Telegraph Company, began offering service in 1847 and Canadian Marconi Company (CMC Electronics) was formed in Montreal in 1903.", "The industry is the economy sector which was hardest hit by the UN sanctions and trade embargo and NATO bombing during the 1990s and transition to market economy during the 2000s.[193] The industrial output saw dramatic downsizing: in 2013 it was expected to be only a half of that of 1989.[194] Main industrial sectors include: automotive, mining, non-ferrous metals, food-processing, electronics, pharmaceuticals, clothes.", "The Canadian Shield is a physiographic division, consisting of five smaller, physiographic provinces: the Laurentian Upland, Kazan Region, Davis, Hudson and James.[1] The shield extends into the United States as the Adirondack Mountains (connected by the Frontenac Axis) and the Superior Upland. The Canadian Shield is U-shaped and is a subsection of the Laurentia craton signifying the area of greatest glacial impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The Canadian Shield is more than 3.96 billion years old. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.[5]", "The area is part of the Canadian Shield and is largely made up of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks. Relief has been eroded by successive glaciations in the Pleistocene era, as recently as 6,000 years ago, leaving depositions of loose materials: moraines, clay, silt and sand and reshaped the hydrography of the territory.[3]", "Natural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at Voisey's Bay. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.", "Even though Canada lags far behind its counterparts in its amount of central bank gold reserves, Canadian companies dominate the industry. These companies are big players in the Canadian industry which ranks 7th globally[58] but rely mostly on assets in foreign countries (Barrick Gold alone produced 209.79 tonnes of gold in 2009,[59] Canada produced 100 tonnes). In fact 75% of the world's mining companies are headquartered in Canada.[60] Canada's biggest undeveloped gold deposit is the Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell copper-gold property in northwestern British Columbia; It holds 38.2 million ounces of gold (2P reserves steady in 2012, up 27% in 2011).[61] Another project in the Detour Lake area of Ontario ranks 4th among North America's deposits (up from six in July 2010).[62][63][64] Among the largest gold containing properties controlled by Canadian companies is Goldcorp's wholly owned billion ounce silver, 18 million ounce gold Penasquito mine in Mexico and Ivanhoe Mines' 81.3 billion pound copper, 46.4 million ounce gold Oyu Tolgoi deposit in Mongolia.[65][66] Barrick Gold owns 50% of Super Pit, Australia's biggest gold mine.[67]", "British Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. It now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west, comprising 72% of industry (compared to 60% Western Canadian average).[68] The largest section of this employment is in finance, insurance, real estate and corporate management. Many areas outside of metropolitan areas, however, are still heavily reliant on resource extraction. With its film industry known as Hollywood North, the Vancouver region is the third-largest feature film production location in North America, after Los Angeles and New York City.[69]", "About 1,400 communities within the Boreal region rely on resource industries for at least part of the livelihood and stability. Many of these communities were carved out of the forest to support a sawmill, pulp and paper mill, mine or railway maintenance facility. Boreal forestry activities support almost 400,000 direct and indirect jobs across Canada. Forestry, pulp and paper, mining, and oil and gas exploration and development are the largest industries along with tourism, trapping, recreation, light manufacturing and the services to support industry and communities. The forest products sector is one of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest export industries, representing approximately 3% of GDP, with about half of the annual wood harvest coming from the boreal forest.[52]", "Around 10% of jobs are in manufacturing.[51] Principal products include pulp and paper, processed food, metal/wood items, chemicals, electronics and electrical equipment, and printed materials.

Aaow!\".[7]", "At the start of the year Garth Brooks was at number one with \"Longneck Bottle\", which had been in the top spot since the chart dated December 20, 1997 and remained there until the chart dated January 10, when it was replaced by \"A Broken Wing\" by Martina McBride.  Brooks went on to have two further number ones in 1998, \"Two Pi\u00f1a Coladas\" and a cover version of Bob Dylan's \"To Make You Feel My Love\".  Unrelated singer Kix Brooks and his musical partner Ronnie Dunn, collectively known as Brooks & Dunn, also had three number ones in 1998, with \"How Long Gone\", \"Husbands and Wives\" and \"If You See Him/If You See Her\", a collaboration with vocalist Reba McEntire.  Other acts to reach number one with more than one song in 1998 were Clint Black, Faith Hill, Hill's husband Tim McGraw, Jo Dee Messina, George Strait, Shania Twain and Dixie Chicks, whose two chart-toppers came from Wide Open Spaces, their first album to feature new vocalist Natalie Maines.[2]", "According to Bernard Sumner, \"Blue Monday\" was influenced by four songs: the arrangement came from \"Dirty Talk\", by Klein + M.B.O.; the signature bassline with octaves came from Sylvester's disco classic, \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\"; the beat came from \"Our Love\", by Donna Summer; the choir sound was sampled from the Kraftwerk song \"Uranium\" from the Radio-Activity album[11] and the long keyboard pad on the intro and outro was following the album's intro track \"Geiger Counter\".", "The song was the fifth of seven songs by the Beatles to hit number 1 in a one-year period, an all-time record on the US charts. In order, these were \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", \"She Loves You\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"Love Me Do\", \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"I Feel Fine\" and \"Eight Days a Week\". It was also the sixth of seven songs written by Lennon-McCartney to hit number 1 in 1964, an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number 1 in the same calendar year (see List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones).", "King wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album, several of which had already been hits for other artists such as Aretha Franklin's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and The Shirelles' \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" (in 1960). Three songs were co-written with King's ex-husband Gerry Goffin. James Taylor, who encouraged King to sing her own songs and who also played on Tapestry, would later have a number one hit with \"You've Got a Friend\". Two songs were co-written with Toni Stern: \"It's Too Late\" and \"Where You Lead\".", "\"Saving All My Love for You\" was written by Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin during the 1970s and originally recorded with Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. on their LP \"Marilyn and Billy\" (1978).[1] Years later, Masser saw Whitney for the first time when he went into New York City's Sweetwater club, an invitation made by Arista Records president Clive Davis, and she was singing one of his songs, \"The Greatest Love of All\". After her performance, the singer told Masser that the song was one of her favorites and later, Masser was chosen by Arista to produce some tracks for Houston's self-titled debut.[2] After getting the right emotionally vulnerable-tailored take from Houston, the producer guaranteed her that it would become \"a woman's song\", meaning that women will feel a special affinity for the song.[2]", "\"Feel Like Makin' Love\" is a song composed by singer-songwriter Eugene McDaniels, and recorded originally by soul singer-songwriter Roberta Flack. The song has been covered by several R&B and jazz artists.", "The song was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, part of the legendary Brill Building pop machine in New York City.[3] They first began writing it following the success of the Righteous Brothers' first single with Phil Spector, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\", which they also wrote.  However, the song was not completed as they thought it sounded too much like \"Lovin' Feelin\",[4] and Spector chose instead to record Carole King and Gerry Goffin's \"Just Once in My Life\" as the duo's second single.[5]", "In 1977, Giorgio Moroder again became responsible for a development in disco. Alongside Donna Summer and Pete Bellotte he wrote the song \"I Feel Love\" for Summer to perform. It became the first well-known disco song to have a completely synthesised backing track. The song is still considered to have been well ahead of its time. Other disco producers, most famously Tom Moulton, grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased Jamaican migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the \"four on the floor\" style that dominated. DJ Larry Levan utilized styles from dub and jazz and remixing techniques to create early versions of house music that sparked the genre.[70]", "In addition to his work with the Emotions and Deniece Williams, White collaborated with several other famous recording artists. For example, he played the drums on Minnie Riperton's debut 1970 album, Come to My Garden, and contributed vocals to Weather Report's 1978 album Mr. Gone. White also produced Ramsey Lewis' albums: Sun Goddess (1974), Salongo (1976), and Sky Islands (1993), Jennifer Holliday on her 1983 release Feel My Soul, Barbra Streisand on her 1984 platinum album Emotion, Atlantic Starr on their platinum 1986 album All in the Name of Love and Neil Diamond on his 1986 gold album Headed for the Future. During 1980, White sang on a live album with Walter Hawkins and the Family (a popular gospel group) in which he sang a solo along with Walter's brother Edwin on a song called Eternal Life. In addition he co-wrote the song \"Only In Chicago\" with Barry Manilow which was included on his 1980 platinum album Barry, the track \"Tip of My Tongue\" for the rock band the Tubes which appeared on their album Outside Inside, and contributed vocals to Cher's 1987 self-titled platinum album.[34]", "\"Feel Like Making Love\" is a 1993 song by British Jamaican singer Pauline Henry. She was the vocalist in the Scottish band the Chimes.", "\"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Michael Masser recorded as a duet single by Peabo Bryson and Roberta Flack and released in 1983. It became a big hit for the pair, peaking at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100, number five on the Hot Black Singles chart,[1] and number four on the Adult Contemporary chart.[2] In the UK, the song peaked at number two in September 1983. In addition to becoming the biggest British hit for both Bryson and Flack, the song boosted the careers of both stars and brought them both a return to prominence. Capitol Records' Bob Hart asked Martin Pitts to Direct the official video through One Heart Productions. The video was a performance with the original band in the background at the Capitol studios on Vine Street in Hollywood."]}, {"query": "where did immigrants enter the us on the west coast", "similarities": [0.753237247467041, 0.7305954098701477, 0.7264963388442993, 0.7227852940559387, 0.7212393879890442, 0.7191523313522339, 0.7098958492279053, 0.7088495492935181, 0.7088495492935181, 0.7081936001777649, 0.7058382630348206, 0.7046729922294617, 0.7011691331863403, 0.6964004039764404, 0.695496141910553, 0.6954758167266846, 0.6953115463256836, 0.69527268409729, 0.6943145394325256, 0.694276750087738, 0.694061815738678, 0.693645179271698, 0.6936231255531311, 0.6908760070800781, 0.6906285285949707, 0.6906057000160217, 0.6903673410415649, 0.6900726556777954, 0.6892889738082886, 0.6889249682426453, 0.6885627508163452, 0.688119113445282, 0.6876217126846313, 0.6872476935386658, 0.6866943836212158, 0.685792863368988, 0.6851412057876587, 0.6834864020347595, 0.6827589869499207, 0.6820294857025146, 0.6817907094955444, 0.6817051768302917, 0.6811553239822388, 0.6804739236831665, 0.6799517869949341, 0.6798605918884277, 0.6797670722007751, 0.6797230243682861, 0.6796858310699463, 0.6794187426567078], "hits": ["It is estimated that approximately 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout half by land and half by sea.[45] Of these, perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 were Americans, and the rest were from other countries.[38] By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world.[46] The largest group continued to be Americans, but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans, Chinese, Britons, Australians,[47] French, and Latin Americans,[48] together with many smaller groups of miners, such as African Americans, Filipinos, Basques[49] and Turks.[50][51]", "Americans continued arriving on the west coast of North America in significant numbers in the mid-1830s.  They first came overland along the Oregon Trail, settling primarily in the rich Willamette Valley south of today's Portland.  By 1841, the first overland party of American settlers reached California along what became the California Trail, and by the mid-1840s significant numbers of Americans were arriving in California.", "The first major wave of Asian immigration to the continental United States occurred primarily on the West Coast during the California Gold Rush, starting in the 1850s. Whereas Chinese immigrants numbered less than 400 in 1848, there were 25,000 by 1852.[13] Most Chinese immigrants in California, which they called Gam Saan (\"Gold Mountain\"), were also from Guangdong province; they sought sanctuary from conflicts such as the Opium Wars and ensuing economic instability, and hoped to earn wealth to send back to their families.[14] As in Hawaii, many capitalists in California and elsewhere (including as far as North Adams, Massachusetts[15]) sought Asian immigrants to fill an increasing demand for labor in gold mines, factories, and on the Transcontinental Railroad. Some plantation owners in the South sought Chinese labor as a cheap means to replace the free labor of slavery.[16] Chinese laborers generally arrived in California with the help of brokers in Hong Kong and other ports under the credit-ticket system, where they would pay back money loaned from brokers with their wages upon arrival.[17] In addition to laborers, merchants also migrated from China, opening businesses and stores, including those that would form the beginnings of Chinatowns.[18]", "After its opening, Ellis Island was again expanded, and additional structures were built. By the time it closed on November 12, 1954, 12 million immigrants had been processed by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration.[33] It is estimated that 10.5 million immigrants departed for points across the United States from the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal, just across a narrow strait.[36][37] Others would have used one of the other terminals along the North River (Hudson River) at that time.[38] At first, the majority of immigrants arriving through the station were Northern and Western Europeans (Germany, France, Switzerland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and the Scandinavian countries). Eventually, these groups of peoples slowed in the rates that they were coming in, and immigrants came in from Southern and Eastern Europe, including Jews. Many reasons these immigrants came to the United States included escaping political and economic oppression, as well as persecution, destitution, and violence. Other groups of peoples being processed through the station were Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, Slovaks, Greeks, Syrians, Turks, and Armenians.[8]", "Japanese, Korean, and South Asian immigrants also arrived in the continental United States starting from late 1800s and onwards to fill demands for labor.[19] Japanese immigrants were primarily farmers facing economic upheaval during the Meiji Restoration; they began to migrate in large numbers to the continental United States (having already been migrating to Hawaii since 1885) in the 1890s, after Chinese exclusion (see below).[20] By 1924, 180,000 Japanese immigrants had gone to the mainland. Filipino migration to North America continued in this period, with reports of \"Manila men\" in early gold camps in Mariposa County, California in the late 1840s.[21] The 1880 census counted 105,465 Chinese and 145 Japanese, indicating that Asian immigration to the continent by this point consisted primarily of Chinese immigrants, overwhelmingly present in California.[22]", "Large-scale migration from Asia to the United States began when Chinese immigrants arrived on the West Coast in the mid-19th century.[90] Forming part of the California gold rush, these early Chinese immigrants participated intensively in the mining business and later in the construction of the transcontinental railroad.[91] By 1852, the number of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco had jumped to more than 20,000. A wave of Japanese immigration to the United States began after the Meiji Restoration in 1868.[92] In 1898, all Filipinos in the Philippine Islands became American nationals when the United States took over colonial rule of the islands from Spain following the latter's defeat in the Spanish\u2013American War.[93]", "Emigration to the west decreased over the following years, but it is likely that the drop in numbers was caused more by fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican War than by the cautionary tale of the Donner Party.[149] In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 people went west in 1849.[151] Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.[152]", "Mass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several waves. Historians identify several waves of migration to the United States: one from 1815 to 1860, in which some five million English, Irish, Germanic, Scandinavian, and others from northwestern Europe came to the United States; one from 1865 to 1890, in which some 10 million immigrants, also mainly from northwestern Europe, settled, and a third from 1890 to 1914, in which 15 million immigrants, mainly from central, eastern, and southern Europe (many Austrian, Hungarian, Turkish, Lithuanian, Russian, Jewish, Greek, Italian, and Romanian) settled in the United States.[146]", "Mass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several waves.

Recruiters in Mexico of the Fernando Rivera y Moncada expedition and other expeditions later, who were charged with founding an agricultural community in Alta California, had a difficult time persuading people to emigrate to such an isolated outpost with no agriculture, no towns, no stores or developments of almost any kind. The majority of settlers were recruited from the northwestern parts of Mexico. The only tentative link with Mexico was via ship after the Quechans (Yumas) closed the Colorado River's Yuma Crossing in 1781. For the next 40 years, an average of only 2.5 ships per year visited California with 13 years showing no recorded ships arriving.", "From 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, 27.5 million in total. In all, 24.4 million (89%) came from Europe, including 2.9 million from Britain, 2.2 million from Ireland, 2.1 million from Scandinavia, 3.8 million from Germany, 4.1 million from Italy, 7.8 million from Russia and other parts of eastern and central Europe. Another 1.7 million came from Canada.[65] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892, through the immigration station on Ellis Island, but various ethnic groups settled in different locations. New York and other large cities of the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[66]", "I = Number of Immigrants Entering the Area", "It is estimated that by 1855, at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world.[50]:25 The huge numbers of newcomers brought by the Gold Rush drove Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners, provoking counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered.[53]", "In the 19th Century, Sino-U.S. maritime trade began the history of Chinese Americans. At first only a handful of Chinese came, mainly as merchants, former sailors, to America. The first Chinese people of this wave arrived in the United States around 1815. Subsequent immigrants that came from the 1820s up to the late 1840s were mainly men. In 1834 Afong Moy became the first female Chinese immigrant to the United States; she was brought to New York City from her home of Guangzhou by Nathaniel and Frederick Carne, who exhibited her as \"the Chinese Lady\".[10][11][12] By 1848, there were 325 Chinese Americans. 323 more immigrants came in 1849, 450 in 1850 and 20,000 in 1852 (2,000 in 1 day).[13] By 1852, there were 25,000; over 300,000 by 1880: a tenth of the Californian population\u2014mostly from six districts of Canton (Guangdong) province (Bill Bryson, p.\u00a0143)[14]\u2014who wanted to make their fortune in the 1849-era California Gold Rush. The Chinese did not, however, only come for the gold rush in California, but also helped build the First Transcontinental Railroad, worked the southern plantations after the Civil War, and participated in setting up California's agriculture and fisheries.[15][16][17] They were also fleeing the Taiping Rebellion that affected their region. From the outset, they were faced with the racism of settled European population, which included massacres and pressuring of Chinese migrants into what became known as Chinatowns.[18] Also with regard to the legal situation, the Chinese were by far more badly posed in the United States than most other ethnic minorities. They had to pay special taxes (all foreign miners had to pay a tax of $20 a month), were not allowed to marry white European partners and could not acquire U.S. citizenship.[19]", "Also a significant number of Middle Eastern immigrants such as Lebanese, Syrians and Armenians settle near the U.S. border, and small waves of settlers in the early 20th century, usually members of the Molokan sect of the Russian Orthodox church fled the Russian Revolution of 1917 when the Soviet Union took power, had established a few villages along the Pacific coast south of Ensenada.[citation needed]", "Since the West Coast has been populated by immigrants more recently than the East Coast, its culture is considerably younger. Additionally, its demographic composition underlies its cultural difference from the rest of the United States. California's history first as a major Spanish colony, and later Mexican territory, has given the lower West Coast a distinctive Hispanic tone, which it also shares with the rest of the Southwest. Similarly, two of the three cities in which Asian Americans have concentrated, San Francisco and Los Angeles,[4][5][6] are located on the West Coast, with significant populations in other West Coast cities. San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest in North America, is a vibrant cultural center[citation needed].", "The \"huddled masses\" are the many immigrants coming to the United States (many of them through Ellis Island at the port of New York).", "California's location along the Pacific coast and its rapidly growing population initially led to the constructions of major seaports at San Francisco in the San Francisco Bay area and inland ports at Sacramento, etc. The first paddle steamer, the SS\u00a0California, arrived in the port of San Francisco on February 29, 1849, with over 400 passengers trying to get to the gold rush territory. She left New York City October 6, 1848, before the gold discoveries were verified and the gold rush truly stated.  Shipment of passengers and freight to Sacramento was accomplished by off-loading the cargoes and passengers onto paddle steamers for transit up the Sacramento River to Sacramento, Stockton, etc. As the population spread out and grew ports were established up and down the California coast with other major ports in Long Beach, Los Angeles and San Diego. The largest U.S. Naval base on the west coast is now in San Diego. (See: Maritime history of California for more information.) The state's shipping industry evolved to handle cargoes to and from California to Europe and the eastern United States and help support the growing international trade with South America, Asia and Oceania. During World War II, numerous military bases and various wartime industries were quickly established in the state to support the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic ocean fleets\u2014ships could use the Panama Canal to get from ocean to ocean. California led in the number of merchant ships built at the Kaiser shipyards in Richmond and the Los Angeles areas. Mare Island Naval Shipyard (now closed) in the San Francisco Bay built submarines as well as repaired many of the ships used by the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet in World War II. The rapidly growing California aircraft industries was greatly expanded. Since then these defense connected industries have largely closed down or moved to cheaper areas in the U.S.", "Historian James N. Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated. Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.[30] The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time. After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.[31]", "During the California Gold Rush, fortune hunters from the United States' East Coast sailed from New York Harbor and other Atlantic ports to Mexican ports in the Gulf of Mexico. After landing, the aspiring miners travelled over land for weeks to Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n, where they would embark from the port to arrive in San Francisco in another four to five weeks.", "In the West:", "To fill the new factory jobs, immigrants poured into the United States in the first mass wave of immigration in the 1840s and 1850s. Known as the period of old immigration, this time saw 4.2 million immigrants come into the United States raising the overall population by 20 million people. Historians often describe this as a time of \u201cpush-pull\u201d immigration. People who were \u201cpushed\u201d to the United States immigrated because of poor conditions back home that made survival dubious while immigrants who were \u201cpulled\u201d came from stable environments to find greater economic success. One group who was \u201cpushed\u201d to the United States was the Irish, who were attempting to escape the Great Famine in their nation. Settling around the coastal cities of Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, the Irish were not initially welcomed because of their poverty and Roman Catholic beliefs. They lived in crowded, filthy neighborhoods and performed low-paying and physically demanding jobs. The Catholic Church was widely distrusted by many Americans as a symbol of European autocracy. German immigrations, on the other hand, were \u201cpulled\u201d to America to avoid a looming financial disaster in their nation. Unlike the Irish, the German immigrants often sold their possessions and arrived in America with money in hand. German immigrants were both Protestant and Catholic, although the latter did not face the discrimination that the Irish did. Many Germans settled in communities in the Midwest rather than on the coast. Major cities such as Cincinnati, Ohio and St. Louis, Missouri developed large German populations. Unlike the Irish, most German immigrants were educated, middle-class people who mainly came to America for political rather than economic reasons. In the big cities such as New York, immigrants often lived in ethnic enclaves called \u201cghettos\u201d that were often impoverished and crime-ridden. The most infamous of these immigrant neighborhoods was the Five Points in New York City. With increasing labor agitation for higher wages and better working conditions in places like Lowell, Massachusetts, many factory owners began to replace female workers with immigrants who would work cheaper and were less demanding about factory conditions.", "These immigrants consisted of two groups: The last big waves of the \"Old Immigration\" from Germany, Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia, and the rising waves of the \"New Immigration\", which peaked about 1910. Some men moved back and forth across the Atlantic, but most were permanent settlers. They moved into well-established communities, both urban and rural. The German American communities spoke German, but their younger generation was bilingual.[104] The Scandinavian groups generally assimilated quickly; they were noted for their support of reform programs, such as prohibition.[105]", "In the 1870s in the western states Irish Americans targeted violence against Chinese workers, driving them out of smaller towns. Denis Kearney, an immigrant from Ireland, led a mass movement in San Francisco in the 1870s that incited attacks on the Chinese there and threatened public officials and railroad owners.[42] The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many nativist acts of Congress which attempted to limit the flow of immigrants into the U.S.. The Chinese responded to it by filing false claims of American birth, enabling thousands of them to immigrate to California.[43] The exclusion of the Chinese caused the western railroads to begin importing Mexican railroad workers in greater numbers (\"traqueros\").[44]", "Since 1960, large numbers of migrants from southern Mexican states have arrived to work in agriculture (esp. the Mexicali Valley and nearby Imperial Valley, California, US) and manufacturing. The cities of Ensenada, Tijuana and Mexicali grew as a result of migrants, primarily those who sought US citizenship and those temporary residents awaiting their entry into the United States are called Flotillas, which is derived from the Spanish word \"flota,\" meaning \"fleet.\"", "Also noted is California has small West Indian (Afro-Caribbean American) and African immigration from countries such as Cape Verde, Eritrea and Ethiopia (i.e. Little Ethiopia in West Los Angeles), Ghana, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa (including White South Africans), Tanzania and Yemen across from the Horn of Africa. They established communities in Los Angeles known for a large Ethiopian community and Oakland/Berkeley (East Bay) as well Nuer refugees from South Sudan migrated to the Sacramento area; and the Cape Verdean community in Solano County and the Santa Clara Valley, and the San Diego area.", "Between 1890 and 1910, more than 12 million European people immigrated to the United States. They came from Ireland, Russia, Italy and other European countries and provided cheap factory labor, a demand that was created with the country's expansion into the west following the Civil War. Many immigrants lived in crowded and disease-ridden tenements, worked long hours, and lived in poverty. Children often worked to help support the family. Jacob Riis wrote How the Other Half Lives about the lives of immigrants on New York City's Lower East Side to bring greater awareness of the immigrant's living conditions.[4]", "Immigration increased throughout the latter half of the 19th century. Starting with refugees from the Irish potato famine in the 1840s, New York became a prominent entry point for those seeking a new life in the United States.[38] Between 1855 and 1890, an estimated 8 million immigrants passed through Castle Clinton at Battery Park in Manhattan.[40][Note 5] Early in this period, most immigrants came from Ireland and Germany. Ellis Island opened in 1892,[40] and between 1880 and 1920, most immigrants were German and Eastern European Jews, Poles, and other eastern and southern Europeans, including many Italians. By 1925, New York City's population outnumbered that of London, making it the most populous city in the world.[38] Arguably New York's most identifiable symbol, Liberty Enlightening the World (the Statue of Liberty), a gift from France for the American centennial, was completed in 1886. By the early 20th century, the statue was regarded as the \"Mother of Exiles\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201da symbol of hope to immigrants.[42]", "After 1880 larger steam-powered oceangoing ships replaced sailing ships, which resulted in lower fares and greater immigrant mobility.  In addition, the expansion of a railroad system in Europe made it easier for people to reach oceanic ports to board ships.  Meanwhile, farming improvements in Southern Europe and the Russian Empire created surplus labor. Young people between the ages of 15 to 30 were predominant among newcomers. This wave of migration, constituting the third episode in the history of U.S. immigration, may be better referred to as a flood of immigrants, as nearly 25 million Europeans made the long trip. Italians, Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, and others speaking Slavic languages made up the bulk of this migration. 2.5 to 4 million Jews were among them.", "In the first half of the 19th century, most immigrants arriving in New York City landed at docks on the east side of the tip of Manhattan, around South Street. On August 1, 1855, Castle Clinton became the Emigrant Landing Depot, functioning as the New York State immigrant processing center (the nation's first such entity). It was operated by the state until April 18, 1890,[4] when the U. S. government assumed control of immigration processing, soon moving the center to the larger, more isolated Ellis Island facility on January 2, 1892. The new facility was needed because immigrants were known to carry diseases, which led to epidemics of cholera and smallpox. After many unnecessary deaths, and scandals over immigration workers cheating and stealing from immigrants, the immigration center was moved to Ellis Island.[5] Most of Castle Clinton's immigrant passenger records were destroyed in a fire that consumed the first structures on Ellis Island on 15 June 1897,[6] but it is generally accepted that over 8 million immigrants (and perhaps as many as 12 million) were processed during its operation. Called Kesselgarten by Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews, a Kesselgarten became a generic term for any situation that was noisy, confusing or chaotic, or where a \"babel\" of languages was spoken (a reference to the multitude of languages heard spoken by the immigrants from many countries at the site).[citation needed] Prominent persons associated with the administration of the immigrant station included Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Friedrich Kapp, and John Alexander Kennedy.", "In this era, much of the west coast of North America transformed from an area still largely populated by indigenous peoples to widespread population of non-natives.  In particular, the west coast of the United States showed the most dramatic change, beginning with the California Gold Rush and the subsequent opening of the transcontinental railroads, through the development of Hollywood in Southern California, and increased industry and agriculture in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.  Canadian and Mexican development also proceeded during this time, but at a slower pace.[30]", "San Diego has historically been a popular destination for Filipino immigrants, and has contributed to the growth of its population.[102] The first documentation of Filipinos arriving in San Diego, while part of the United States, occurred in 1903 when Filipino students arrived at State Normal School;[103][104] they were followed as early as 1908 by Filipino Sailors serving in the United States Navy.[105] Due to discriminatory housing policies of the time, the majority of Filipinos in San Diego lived downtown, around Market.[103] Multiple businesses which catered to the Filipino community, both those who permanently lived in San Diego or who were migratory, existed in the area forming a hub to the Filipino American community, which lasted until at least the 1960s.[106] Prior to World War II, due to anti-miscegination laws, multi-racial marriages with Hispanic and Latino women were common, particularly with Mexicans.[107]", "Historically, the state has had sizable East Asian immigration. Mexicali has a large Chinese community, as well as many Filipinos from the Philippines who arrived to the state during the eras of Spanish and American rule (1898\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1946) in much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Tijuana and Ensenada were a major port of entry for East Asians entering the U.S. ever since the first Asian-Americans were present in California.", "More than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than 100 million Americans across the United States can trace their ancestry to these immigrants.", "These census numbers show a 363,000 population increase in the western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870.", "The Polish exiles settled in the United States. One of them was a doctor of medicine and a soldier, Felix Wierzbicki, a veteran of the November Uprising, who, in 1849, published the first English-language book printed in California,[27] California as it is, and as it may be.[28] The book is a description of the culture, peoples, and climate of the area at that time. According to the Library of Congress, the book was a valuable guide to California for prospective settlers that includes a survey of agriculture, hints on gold mining, a guide to San Francisco, and a chapter on California's Hispanic residents and Native American tribes.[29]", "In the wake of the 1853 recession, many Californians who owned the rights to the land on which the gold was mined were looking for cheap labor to maximize profits. Chinese immigrants came to America for a variety of reasons, including longstanding trans-Pacific economic connections, a culture of migrant work in the Pearl River delta region, and the presence of reasonably fast trade routes to the United States, and the allure of gold.[2] Many Chinese immigrants made the voyage on credit, and upon arrival in California had no choice but to accept lower wages to repay their creditors. As a result of their lower demand for wages, and their tendency to form self-supporting communities without much support from their employers, Chinese immigrants became the preferred option of labor for many landowners. Domestic miners responded with the creation of \u201canticoolie\u201d clubs that sought to create clear divisions between white workers and Chinese workers. The clubs almost served like white unions that represented the interests of the white miners in the west, and they expanded in prominence as manufacturing jobs moved to the west and Chinese workers continued to play the role of cheap labor. In 1857, just a few years prior to the passage of the Anti-Coolie Act in California, Chinese workers were accepting wages between one and two dollars less than their white counterparts.", "The ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 21 June 1948,[18][19] and the 1027 passengers began disembarking the next day. A commonly given figure for the number of West Indian immigrants on board is 492[2][19] based understandably on news reports in the media at the time, which variously announced that \"more than 400\", \"430\" or \"500\" Jamaican men had arrived in Britain.[20][21][22] However, the ship's records, kept in the United Kingdom National Archives indicate conclusively that 802 passengers gave their last place of residence as a country in the Caribbean.[1]", "Although a small number of American traders and trappers had lived in California since the early 1830s, the first organized overland party of American immigrants was the Bartleson\u2013Bidwell Party of 1841. With mules and on foot, this pioneering group groped its way across the continent using the still untested California Trail.[29] Also in 1841, an overland exploratory party of the United States Exploring Expedition came down the Siskiyou Trail from the Pacific Northwest. In 1844, Caleb Greenwood guided the first settlers to take wagons over the Sierra Nevada. In 1846, the misfortunes of the Donner Party earned notoriety as they struggled to enter California.", "Since the late-1980s immigration patterns changed. Many Cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts of Cuba and arrived at the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico; many landed on Isla Mujeres. From there Cuban immigrants traveled to the Texas-Mexico border and found asylum. Many of the Cubans who did not have family in Miami settled in Houston.[4] The term \"dusty foot\" refers to Cubans immigrating to the U.S. through Mexico.[4]", "Spain on the west coast of North America: For Europeans in the Age of Exploration western North America was one of the most distant places on earth (9 to 12 months of sailing). Spain had long claimed the entire west coast of the Americas. The area north of Mexico however was given little attention in the early years. This changed when the Russians appeared in Alaska. The Spanish moved north to California and built a series of missions along the Pacific coast including: San Diego in 1767, Monterey, California in 1770 and San Francisco in 1776. San Francisco Bay was discovered in 1769 by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 from the landward side because its mouth is not obvious from the sea. The Spanish settlement of San Francisco remained the northern limit of land occupation. By sea, from 1774 to 1793 the Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest tried to assert Spanish claims against the Russians and British. In 1774 Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez reached what is now the south end of the Alaska panhandle. In 1778 Captain Cook sailed the west coast and spent a month at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. An expedition led by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra sailed north to Nootka and reached Prince William Sound. In 1788 Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez went north and met the Russians for the first time (Unalaska and Kodiak Island) and heard that the Russians were planning to occupy Nootka Sound. In 1789 Martinez went north to build a fort at Nootka and found British and American merchant ships already there. He seized a British ship which led to the Nootka Crisis and Spanish recognition of non-Spanish trade on the northwest coast. In 1791 the Malaspina expedition mapped the Alaska coast. In 1792 Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano circumnavigated Vancouver Island. In 1792-93 George Vancouver also mapped the complex coast of British Columbia. Vancouver Island was originally named Quadra's and Vancouver's Island in commemoration of the friendly negotiations held by the Spanish commander of the Nootka Sound settlement, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra and British naval captain George Vancouver in Nootka Sound in 1792. In 1793 Alexander Mackenzie reached the Pacific overland from Canada. By this time Spain was becoming involved in the French wars and increasingly unable to assert its claims on the Pacific coast. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition reached the Pacific overland from the Mississippi River. By the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 Spain gave up its claims north of California. Canadian fur traders, and later a smaller number of Americans, crossed the mountains and built posts on the coast. In 1846 the Oregon Treaty divided the Oregon country between Britain and the United States. The United States conquered California in 1848 and purchased Alaska in 1867.", "From the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and the future Canada arrived in Northern California. These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California.", "Prior to the Gilded Age, the time commonly referred to as the old immigration saw the first real boom of new arrivals to the United States. During the Gilded Age, approximately 20 million immigrants came to the United States in what is known as the new immigration. Some of them were prosperous farmers who had the cash to buy land and tools in the Plains states especially. Many were poor peasants looking for the American Dream in unskilled manual labor in mills, mines, and factories. Few immigrants went to the poverty-stricken South, though. To accommodate the heavy influx, the federal government in 1892 opened a reception center at Ellis Island near the Statue of Liberty.[103]", "The Chinese came to California in large numbers during the California Gold Rush, with 40,400 being recorded as arriving from 1851 to 1860, and again in the 1860s when the Central Pacific Railroad recruited large labor gangs, many on five-year contracts, to build its portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The Chinese laborers worked out well and thousands more were recruited until the railroad's completion in 1869. Chinese labor provided the massive labor needed to build the majority of the Central Pacific's difficult railroad tracks through the Sierra Nevada mountains and across Nevada. The Chinese population rose from 2,716 in 1851 to 63,000 by 1871. In the decade 1861\u201370, 64,301 were recorded as arriving, followed by 123,201 in 1871\u201380 and 61,711 in 1881\u201390. 77% were located in California, with the rest scattered across the West, the South, and New England.[37] Most came from Southern China looking for a better life; escaping a high rate of poverty left after the Taiping Rebellion. This immigration may have been as high as 90% male as most immigrated with the thought of returning home to start a new life. Those that stayed in America faced the lack of suitable Chinese brides as Chinese women were not allowed to emigrate in significant numbers after 1872. As a result, the mostly bachelor communities slowly aged in place with very low Chinese birth rates.", "The history of immigration to the United States details the movement of people to the United States starting with the first European settlements from around 1600. Beginning around this time, British and other Europeans settled primarily on the east coast. In 1619, Africans began being imported as slaves.  The United States experienced successive waves of immigration, particularly from Europe.  Immigrants sometimes paid  the cost of transoceanic transportation by becoming indentured servants after their arrival in the New World. Later, immigration rules became more restrictive; the ending of numerical restrictions occurred in 1965. Recently, cheap air travel has increased immigration from Asia and Latin America.", "Northern California was the final destination for many of the Massachusetts immigrants who then moved on to the San Joaquin Valley, especially the city of Turlock, just south of Modesto. In the late 1800s many Azoreans emigrated to the Hawaiian islands. The tuna fishing industry drew a significant number of Azoreans to the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego, in Southern California.[52] From 1921 to 1977, about 250,000 Azoreans immigrated to Rhode Island and Massachusetts.[53]", "Thousands of Americans and immigrants moved to the area during the mining boom, prompting the federal government to create Fort Wilkins near Copper Harbor to maintain order. The first wave were the Cornish from England, with centuries of mining experience; followed by Irish, Germans, and French Canadians. During the 1890s, Finnish immigrants began settling there in large numbers, forming the population plurality in the northwestern half of the peninsula. In the early 20th century, 75% of the population was foreign-born.[3]", "A fire destroyed the administration building in 1940, and subsequent immigration processing took place in San Francisco. On November fifth of 1940, the last gathering of around 200 immigrants, including around 150 Chinese, were exchanged from Angel Island to brief quarters in San Francisco.[15]", "The last major immigration wave started around the 1850s. The West Coast of North America was being rapidly colonized during the California Gold Rush, while southern China suffered from severe political and economic instability due to the weakness of the Qing Dynasty government, internal rebellions such as the Taiping Rebellion, and external pressures such as the Opium Wars (1839\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1860). As a result, many Chinese emigrated from the poor Taishanese- and Cantonese-speaking area in Guangdong province travelled to the United States to find work.", "After 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North. By 1870, 1/6 of all the people born in Canada had moved to the United States, with the highest concentrations in New England, which was the destination of Francophone emigrants from Quebec and Anglophone emigrants from the Maritimes. It was common for people to move back and forth across the border, such as seasonal lumberjacks, entrepreneurs looking for larger markets, and families looking for jobs in the textile mills that paid much higher wages than in Canada.[67]"]}, {"query": "what is the lead singers name of staind", "similarities": [0.7508097887039185, 0.7312667369842529, 0.7285975813865662, 0.7280358672142029, 0.7261227369308472, 0.712434709072113, 0.710716962814331, 0.6947773098945618, 0.6885756850242615, 0.6884635090827942, 0.6867824196815491, 0.6835750937461853, 0.6796156167984009, 0.6793508529663086, 0.6770132780075073, 0.6742988228797913, 0.6703022122383118, 0.6662827730178833, 0.6602669358253479, 0.660066545009613, 0.6570277214050293, 0.6567949652671814, 0.6539930701255798, 0.6531261801719666, 0.652592122554779, 0.6497156620025635, 0.6493030786514282, 0.6474173665046692, 0.6452322006225586, 0.6446226835250854, 0.6443707942962646, 0.6437625288963318, 0.6437304615974426, 0.6427121162414551, 0.642056941986084, 0.6418207287788391, 0.6409522891044617, 0.6407023072242737, 0.6403211951255798, 0.6401091814041138, 0.6399288773536682, 0.6396549344062805, 0.6391969919204712, 0.6384152770042419, 0.6379225254058838, 0.6373211741447449, 0.6372767686843872, 0.6370454430580139, 0.636983335018158, 0.6358985304832458], "hits": ["Staind (/ste\u026and/ STAYND) is an American rock band formed in 1995.

The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica.[187][188] James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead's Kid A,[189] while Jordy Kasko of Review, Rinse, Repeat likened the album to both Kid A and Pink Floyd's landmark album The Dark Side of the Moon.[190] Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: \"Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively\".[191] One of the record's political elements is its samples of notable speeches by American political figures.[192]", "On August 19, 2008, Staind released their sixth album, The Illusion of Progress. Prior to the album's release, the track \"This Is It\" was available for download on the iTunes Store, as well as for Rock Band.

The first single on the album, \"Believe\", topped Billboard's Top 10 Modern Rock Tracks on September 5, 2008. The band also supported Nickelback on their 2008 European tour. The second single was \"All I Want\", and came out on November 24. The single also became Staind's 13th top 20 hit on the rock charts. In Europe the second single was \"The Way I Am\", released on January 26, 2009. The final single released from the album, \"This Is It\", was sent to radio stations across the country on May 4, 2009.

The band's appearance at Reading Festival during the 2003 tour had another impromptu acoustic set, this time due to equipment failure. The singles \"So Far Away\" and \"Price to Play\" came with two unreleased tracks, \"Novocaine\" and \"Let It Out\", which were released for the special edition of the group's Chapter V, which came out in late 2005.

They re-opened the case in mid-2005.[15]", "With the departure of Steven Page in early 2009, Kevin Hearn has taken over singing Page's lead vocals on almost all of the choruses (during the first few performances of this song without Page, all of the three choruses were sung by Ed Robertson, until Hearn took over performing the first two of them about a year later, in 2010). Often, Hearn sings the choruses together with drummer Tyler Stewart, who also performs the harmonies during the bridge.

That association has linked the group with \"new metal,\" though Break the Cycle's sound is neither particularly new nor metal. The band doesn't rap, and though Mushok has adopted new-metal's minor-key guitar riffs, Lewis' dramatic voice and the anthemic quality of such songs as \"Open Your Eyes\" and \"Fade\" are more akin to Alice in Chains than to Korn. Aggressive yet reflective, Break the Cycle doesn't require a poisonous abundance of testosterone to be appreciated and is better suited to solitary listening than to the mosh pit.[48]", "It was announced via Andy's Twitter that they would be releasing an EP titled \"Rebels\".

Johann Froben of Basel, Switzerland set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed Erasmus's famous edition of the Greek New Testament) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in Spain and, to a lesser extent in England. His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFroben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text. By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect. These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.", "Early roman typefaces show a variety of designs, for instance characters resembling what would now be considered blackletter.[5][6][7] Printers and typefounders such as Nicolas Jenson and Aldus Manutius in Venice and later Robert Estienne in France codified the modern characteristics of Roman type, for instance an 'h' with a nearly straight right leg, serifs on the outside of the capital 'M' and 'N', and 'e' with level cross stroke, by the 1530s.[8][9]", "Nicolas Jenson began printing in Venice with his original roman font from 1470. Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by Francesco Griffo c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and archetypal roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.", "The name roman is customarily applied uncapitalized distinguishing early Italian typefaces of the Renaissance period and most subsequent upright types based on them, in contrast to Roman letters dating from classical antiquity.[10][11]", "Popular roman typefaces include Bembo, Baskerville, Caslon, Jenson, Times New Roman and Garamond.", "The roman and italic types of John Baskerville c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called Mrs Eaves, is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.[7]", "The development of Roman typeface can be traced back to Greek lapidary letters. Greek lapidary letters were carved into stone and \"one of the first formal uses of Western letterforms\"; after that, Roman lapidary letterforms evolved into the monumental capitals, which laid the foundation for Western typographical design, especially serif typefaces.[33]:10 There are two styles of Roman typefaces: the old style, and the modern. The former is characterized by its similarly weighted lines, while the latter is distinguished by its contrast of light and heavy lines.[31] Often, these styles are combined.", "The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter William Caslon spent 14\u00a0years creating the stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic etc. Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Mikl\u00f3s (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to Anton Janson. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm\u2014its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.", "The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography\u2014Claude Garamond (also Garamont). In 1541 Robert Estienne, printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King Francis I of France, known as the \"grecs du roi\". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, Christoffel Plantijn and the printer Andr\u00e9 Wechel, the types known as \"Canon de Garamond\" and \"Petit Canon de Garamond\" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as Claude Garamond's final roman types.", "The earliest printing typefaces which omitted serifs were not intended to render contemporary texts, but to represent inscriptions in Ancient Greek and Etruscan. Thus, Thomas Dempster's De Etruria regali libri VII (1723), used special types intended for the representation of  Etruscan epigraphy, and in c. 1745, the Caslon foundry made Etruscan types for pamphlets written by Etruscan scholar John Swinton.[39] Another niche used of a printed sans-serif letterform from in 1786 onwards was a rounded sans-serif script font developed by Valentin Ha\u00fcy for the use of the blind to read with their fingers.[40][41][42]", "The ultimate origin of the 'Roman' (regular) style of Plantin and Times New Roman was a metal type created in the late sixteenth century by the French artisan Robert Granjon and preserved in the collection of the Plantin-Moretus Museum of Antwerp.[22][23][24][25] This style is sometimes categorised as part of the old-style of serif fonts. Morison admired this style for its solid structure and clarity.[26][27][f]", "The Spanish designer Joaqu\u00edn Ibarra's roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer William Bulmer c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail g and overall finesse of Baskerville's.", "Times New Roman's creation took place through the influence of Stanley Morison of Monotype. Morison was an artistic director at Monotype, historian of printing and informal adviser to The Times. Asked to advise on a redesign, he recommended that they change their text typeface from a spindly and somewhat dated nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before.[6][7][a][11][12][b] This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period.", "Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of Francois Ambroise Didot and son Firmin Didot closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the \"enlightenment\" of post-revolution France under Napoleon. Francois Ambroise also designed \"maigre\" and \"gras\" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.", "In the nascent stages of European printing, the typeface (blackletter, or Gothic) was designed in imitation of the popular hand-lettering styles of scribes.[31] Initially, this typeface was difficult to read, because each letter was set in place individually and made to fit tightly into the allocated space.[32] The art of manuscript writing, whose origin was during Hellenistic and Roman bookmaking, reached its zenith in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Metal typefaces notably altered the style, making it \"crisp and uncompromising\", and also brought about \"new standards of composition\".[30]\nDuring the Renaissance period in France, Claude Garamond was partially responsible for the adoption of Roman typeface that eventually supplanted the more commonly used Gothic (blackletter).[33]:8 Roman typeface also was based on hand-lettering styles.[34]", "Times New Roman is a serif typeface designed for legibility in body text. It was commissioned by the British newspaper The Times in 1931 and conceived by Stanley Morison, the artistic advisor to the British branch of the printing equipment company Monotype, in collaboration with Victor Lardent, a lettering artist in the Times' advertising department.[1][2] Although no longer used by The Times, Times New Roman is still very common in book and general printing.[3] It has become one of the most popular and influential typefaces in history and a standard typeface on most desktop computers.[4][5]", "In Latin script typography, roman is one of the three main kinds of historical type, alongside blackletter and italic. Roman type was modelled from a European scribal manuscript style of the 15th century, based on the pairing of inscriptional capitals used in ancient Rome with Carolingian minuscules developed in the Holy Roman Empire.[4]", "The name \"roman\" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman \"antiqua\" from its connection with the humanistic \"lettera antica\"; \"medieval\" and \"old-style\" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by Aldus Manutius (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.", "With the spread of printing, several styles of Latin typography emerged with fonts based on various minuscules of the Middle Ages depending on the region. In Germany, starting with Johannes Gutenberg the commonly used typefaces were based on blackletter scripts, a tradition that lasted until the 20th century, an example of the later typefaces used is fraktur.\nIn Italy due to the revival of classical culture the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian Latin types, also called antiqua, which were based on the inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments. However, humanist scholars of the early 15th century mistook Carolingian minuscule as the authentic writing style of the Romans and redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time moveable type reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as humanistic minuscule, which served as the basis for Venetian typeface.", "In 1994 the printing historian Mike Parker published claims that the design of Times New Roman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roman or regular style was based on a 1904 design of William Starling Burgess.[85] This theory remains controversial.[86][87] Parker and his friend Gerald Giampa, a Canadian printer, claimed that in 1904 Burgess created a type design for company documents at his shipyard in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and hired Lanston Monotype to issue it.[87] However, Burgess abandoned the idea and Monotype shelved the sketches, ultimately reusing them as a basis for Times New Roman. Giampa claimed that he stumbled upon original material in 1987, after he had purchased Lanston Monotype. Giampa claimed that some of the papers that had been his evidence had been lost in a flood at his house, while Parker claimed that an additional source was material in a section of the Smithsonian now closed due to asbestos contamination.[87][88] Giampa asked Parker to complete the type from the limited number of surviving letters, which was issued in June 2009 by Font Bureau under the name of 'Starling'.[87][88]", "The roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of Elzevir in Leyden reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's.", "The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful abstract stylization. The carefully modelled serifs follow an artful logic of asymmetry. The ratio of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic \"white space\") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.", "Because an abundance of typefaces has been created over the centuries, they are commonly categorized according to their appearance. At the highest level (in the context of Latin-script fonts), one can differentiate Roman, Blackletter, and Gaelic types. Roman types are in the most widespread use today, and are sub-classified as serif, sans serif, ornamental, and script types. Historically, the first European fonts were blackletter, followed by Roman serif, then sans serif and then the other types. The use of Gaelic faces was restricted to the Irish language, though these form a unique if minority class. Typefaces may be monospaced regardless of whether they are Roman, Blackletter, or Gaelic. Symbol typefaces are non-alphabetic.  The Cyrillic script comes in two varieties, Roman type (called \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 gra\u017edanskij \u0161rift) and traditional Slavonic type (called \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 slavjanskij \u0161rift).[citation needed]", "Contemporary books are more likely to be set with state-of-the-art \"text romans\" or \"book romans\" typefaces with serifs and design values echoing present-day design arts, which are closely based on traditional models such as those of Nicolas Jenson, Francesco Griffo (a punchcutter who created the model for Aldine typefaces), and Claude Garamond. With their more specialized requirements, newspapers and magazines rely on compact, tightly fitted styles of text typefaces with serifs specially designed for the task, which offer maximum flexibility, readability, legibility, and efficient use of page space. Sans serif text typefaces (without serifs) often are used for introductory paragraphs, incidental text, and whole short articles. A current fashion is to pair a sans-serif typeface for headings with a high-performance serif typeface of matching style for the text of an article.", "In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon's biography of famous Germans.[22]", "He was one of the leaders of the movement Elementare Typografie or \"Elementary Typography\". Sometimes also referred to as \"New Typography\" of \"Functional Typography\". His most famous typeface is Sabon.", "In Italy the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian or \"old style\" Latin types, also called antiqua. The inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments were structured on a euclidean geometric scheme and the discrete component-based model of classical architecture. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised serifs became the typographic ideal for western civilization. The best-known example of Roman inscriptional capitals exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.", "The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. Johann B\u00e4mler's Schwabacher, Augsburg appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 was cut to suit Venetian taste. In 1476 William Caxton having learned his craft on the Continent printed the first books in England with a so-called B\u00e2tarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.", "It was only with the First Orthographic Conference in Berlin in 1876 that printers and type foundries started to look for a common letter form to represent the Eszett in Roman type. In 1879, a proposal for various letter forms was published in the Journal f\u00fcr Buchdruckerkunst. A committee of the Typographic Society of Leipzig chose the \"Sulzbacher form\". In 1903 it was proclaimed as the new standard for the Eszett in Roman type.[8]", "Satyajit Ray designed four typefaces for roman script named Ray Roman, Ray Bizarre, Daphnis, and Holiday Script, apart from numerous Bengali ones for the Sandesh magazine.[53][54] Ray Roman and Ray Bizarre won an international competition in 1971.[55] In certain circles of Calcutta, Ray continued to be known as an eminent graphic designer, well into his film career. Ray illustrated all his books and designed covers for them, as well as creating all publicity material for his films, i.e., Ray's artistic playing with the Bengali graphemes was also revealed in the cine posters and cine promo-brochures' covers. He also designed covers of several books by other authors.[56] In his calligraphic technique there are deep impacts of: (a) Artistic pattern of European musical staff notation in the graphemic syntagms; (b) alpana (\"ritual painting\" mainly practiced by Bengali women at the time of religious festival; the term denotes 'to coat with'. Generally categorized as \"Folk\"-Art cf. in Ray's graphemes representations.", "Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in Paris in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Josse Bade) in partnership with Henri Estienne established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and Lyon and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.[3]", "Around 1816, William Caslon IV produced the first sans-serif printing type in England for the Latin alphabet, a capitals-only face under the title 'Two Lines English Egyptian', where 'Two Lines English' referred to the font's body size, which equals to about 28- points.[56][57] No uses of it from the period have been found; Mosley speculates that it may have been commissioned by a specific client.[58]", "[T]he various typefaces used before the introduction (The) Times New Roman  [sic] didn't really have a formal name.", "The long s disappeared from new typefaces rapidly in the mid-1790s, and most printers who could afford to do so had discarded older typefaces by the early years of the 19th century. Pioneer of type design John Bell (1746\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1831), who started the British Letter Foundry in 1788, commissioned the William Caslon Company to produce a new modern typeface for him and is often \"credited with the demise of the long s.\"[8]", "The development of Times New Roman was relatively involved due to the lack of a specific pre-existing model \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or perhaps a surfeit of possible choices. Morison wrote in a memo that he hoped for a design that would have relatively sharp serifs, matching the general design of the Times' previous font, but on a darker and more traditional basic structure. Bulked-up versions of Monotype's pre-existing but rather dainty Baskerville and Perpetua typefaces were considered for a basis, and the Ionic designs from Linotype, such as Excelsior, that were popular in newspaper printing at the time, were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor Eric Gill at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.) Walter Tracy, who knew Lardent, suggested in the 1980s that \"Morison did not begin with a clear vision of the ultimate type, but felt his way along.\"[42]", "The classically endowed city of Rome attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, closely followed by the brothers Johann and Wendelin of Speyer (de Spira), and the Frenchman Nicolas Jenson. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to Venice.", "The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; a with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on i, j, m, n and r; flattened baseline serifs, delicately modeled ascender serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150\u00c2\u00a0years.", "The capitals of the typeface are based on Roman square capitals such as those on the Column of Trajan, and the lower-case on traditional serif fonts. Johnston greatly admired Roman capitals, writing that they \"held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty. They are the best forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions.\"[6] Justin Howes, author of the leading work on the Johnston Sans design, Johnston's Underground Type, has highlighted the similarity of the design to the eighteenth-century Caslon type designed by William Caslon in particular, noting that Johnston had worked on a book printed using this typeface shortly before starting work on his design and reproduced their structure in a textbook.[7]", "Old Style typefaces are influenced by early Italian lettering design.[29] Modern fonts often exhibit a bracketed serif and a substantial difference in weight within the strokes. Though some argument exists as to whether Transitional fonts exist as a discrete category among serif fonts, Transitional fonts lie somewhere between Old Style and Modern style typefaces. Transitional fonts exhibit a marked increase in the variation of stroke weight and a more horizontal serif compared to Old Style. Slab serif designs have particularly large serifs, and date to the early nineteenth century. The earliest slab serif font, Antique, later renamed Egyptian, was first shown in 1815 by the English typefounder Vincent Figgins.[30]", "Slab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces \u2013 a largely English-speaking phenomenon \u2013 came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.", "Around 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe Ludovico Arrighi designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting.", "Caslon's type rapidly built up a reputation for workmanship, being described by Henry Newman in 1733 as \"the work of that Artist who seems to aspire to outvying all the Workmen in his way in Europe, so that our Printers send no more to Holland for the Elzevir and other Letters which they formerly valued themselves much.\"[4][24][c] Mosley describes Caslon's Long Primer No. 1 type as \"type with generous proportions and it was normally cast with letter-spacing that was not too tight, characteristics that are needed in types on a small body. And yet it is so soundly made that words that are set in it keep their shape and are comfortably readable...It is a type that works best in the narrow measure of a two-column page or in quite modest octavos.\"[26] Caslon sold a French Canon face he did not engrave that may to have been the work of Joseph Moxon with some modifications, and his larger-size faces follow this high-contrast model.[14] Compared to the more delicate, stylised and experimental designs that developed in Europe during Caslon's life, notably the romain du roi type and the work of Fleischmann in Amsterdam, and the Baskerville type of John Baskerville in Birmingham that appeared towards the end of Caslon's career, Caslon's type was quite conservative. Johnson notes that his 1764 specimen \"might have been produced a hundred years earlier\".[27] Stanley Morison described Caslon's type as \"a happy archaicism\".[28]", "After their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by Robert Estienne, Simon de Colines and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.", "The modern Latin-alphabet system of fonts appearing in four standard weights, regular (or \"Roman\"), italic, bold and bold italic is a relatively recent development, dating to the early twentieth century. Modern \"Roman\" type was developed around the 1470s, while italic type was developed around 1500 and was commonly used for emphasis by the early 17th century. Bold type did not arrive until the nineteenth century, and at first fonts did not have matching bold weights; instead a generic bold, sometimes a Clarendon or other kind of slab-serif, would be swapped in.[12] In some books printed before bold type existed, emphasis could be shown by switching to blackletter.[13] Some font families intended for professional use in documents such as business reports may also make the bold-style numbers take up the same width as the regular (non-bold) numbers, so a bold-style total lines up below the digits of the sum in regular style.[14]", "During the early Renaissance, roman (in the form of Antiqua) and italic type were used separately. Today, roman and italic type are mixed, and most typefaces are composed of an upright roman style with an associated italic or oblique style.", "The design of typefaces has developed alongside the development of typesetting systems.[29] Although typography has evolved significantly from its origins, it is a largely conservative art that tends to cleave closely to tradition.[30] This is because legibility is paramount, and so the typefaces that are the most readable usually are retained. In addition, the evolution of typography is inextricably intertwined with lettering by hand and related art forms, especially formal styles, which thrived for centuries preceding typography,[30] and so the evolution of typography must be discussed with reference to this relationship.", "During the Times New Roman period The Times also sometimes used Perpetua Titling, also from Monotype, and one of Morison's favourite type designs from his work at Monotype.[50]", "Through the early twentieth century, an increase in popularity of sans-serif fonts took place as more artistic and complex designs were created. As Updike's comments suggest, the more constructed humanist and geometric sans-serif designs were viewed as increasingly respectable, and were shrewdly marketed in Europe and America as embodying classic proportions (with influences of Roman capitals) while presenting a spare, modern image.[73][74][75][76][77] While he disliked sans-serif fonts in general, the American printer J.L Frazier wrote of Copperplate Gothic in 1925 that \"a certain dignity of effect accompanies...due to the absence of anything in the way of frills,\" making it a popular choice for the stationery of professionals such as lawyers and doctors.[78]", "In between these works he found time to write Literarum latinarum, a small instruction manual on the italic script.[40] The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522.[41] It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.[42]", "The first \"extended\" font families, which included a wide range of widths and weights in the same general style emerged in the early 1900s, starting with ATF's Cheltenham (1902\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1913), with an initial design by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, and many additional faces designed by Morris Fuller Benton.[2] Later examples include Futura, Lucida, ITC Officina. Some became superfamilies as a result of revival, such as Linotype Syntax, Linotype Univers; while others have alternate styling designed as compatible replacements of each other, such as Compatil, Generis."]}, {"query": "who spoke the words ich bin ein berliner", "similarities": [0.8052473664283752, 0.7757338881492615, 0.7528312802314758, 0.7440212965011597, 0.7440212965011597, 0.7361843585968018, 0.727356493473053, 0.7272723317146301, 0.7270761132240295, 0.7146295309066772, 0.7106876969337463, 0.7088934183120728, 0.7050081491470337, 0.702057957649231, 0.7002350687980652, 0.698935866355896, 0.69121253490448, 0.6869434714317322, 0.685942530632019, 0.6823918223381042, 0.6795879006385803, 0.6795310378074646, 0.6794632077217102, 0.6761844158172607, 0.6758661270141602, 0.6755310297012329, 0.674826443195343, 0.668396532535553, 0.6677296161651611, 0.6666381359100342, 0.6656116247177124, 0.6654403805732727, 0.6651422381401062, 0.6642868518829346, 0.6640332341194153, 0.6630588173866272, 0.6626135110855103, 0.6623103022575378, 0.6590614914894104, 0.6574913263320923, 0.6573743224143982, 0.6557348370552063, 0.6545579433441162, 0.6536506414413452, 0.6530605554580688, 0.6530302166938782, 0.6515508890151978, 0.6512950658798218, 0.6508010625839233, 0.6505864262580872], "hits": ["\"Ich bin ein Berliner\" (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0294\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8b\u026an \u0294a\u026an b\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0250], \"I am a Berliner\") is a quotation from a June 26, 1963, speech by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in West Berlin. It is widely regarded as the best-known speech of the Cold War and the most famous anti-communist speech. Kennedy aimed to underline the support of the United States for West Germany 22 months after Soviet-supported East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to prevent mass emigration to the West. The message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. Another phrase in the speech was also spoken in German, \"Lasst sie nach Berlin kommen\" (\"Let them come to Berlin\"), addressed at those who claimed \"we can work with the Communists\", a remark at which Nikita Khrushchev scoffed only days later.", "But there are differing accounts on the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner. Plischke wrote a 1997 account[4] of visiting Kennedy at the White House weeks before the trip to help compose the speech and teach him the proper pronunciation; she also claims that the phrase had been translated stateside already by the translator scheduled to accompany him on the trip (\"a rather unpleasant man who complained bitterly that he had had to interrupt his vacation just to watch the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mannerisms\").[5] Additionally, Ted Sorensen claimed in his memoir Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History (2008) to have had a hand in the speech, and said he had incorrectly inserted the word ein, incorrectly taking responsibility for the \"jelly doughnut misconception\", below,[6] a claim apparently supported by Berlin mayor Willy Brandt but dismissed by later scholars since the final typed version, which does not contain the words, is the last one Sorensen could have worked on.[3] Robert Lochner claimed in his memoirs that Kennedy had asked him for a translation of \"I am a Berliner\", and that they practiced the phrase in Brandt's office.[3] Daum credited the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner to Kennedy and his 1962 speech in New Orleans quoted above. According to Daum, Kennedy was affected by seeing the Berlin Wall, so that he \"falls back on the most memorable passage of his New Orleans speech given the year before, changing pride in being an American in being a Berliner.\"[3]", "The Ich bin ein Berliner speech is in part derived from a speech Kennedy gave at a Civic Reception on May 4, 1962, in New Orleans; there also he used the phrase civis Romanus sum by saying \"Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was to say, \"I am a citizen of Rome.\" Today, I believe, in 1962 the proudest boast is to say, \"I am a citizen of the United States.\" And it is not enough to merely say it; we must live it. Anyone can say it. But Americans who serve today in West Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyour sons and brothers --[...] are the Americans who are bearing the great burden.\"[2] The phrases \"I am a Berliner\" and \"I am proud to be in Berlin\" were typed already a week before the speech on a list of expressions to be used, including a phonetic transcription of the German translation. Such transcriptions are also found in the third draft of the speech (in Kennedy's own handwriting), from June 25. The final typed version of the speech does not contain the transcriptions, which are added by hand by Kennedy himself.[3]", "Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was civis romanus sum [\"I am a Roman citizen\"]. Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"... All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"", "Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was civis romanus sum [\"I am a Roman citizen\"]. Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"... All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"", "On 26 June 1963, President Kennedy visited West Berlin and gave a public speech known for its famous phrase \"Ich bin ein Berliner\".", "'Ich bin ein Berliner,' I said. It was a joke. A Berliner is a doughnut. The day after President Kennedy made his famous proclamation, Berlin cartoonists had a field day with talking doughnuts.[15]", "The speech culminated with the second use in the speech of the Ich bin ein Berliner phrase: \"Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner!\" The crowd was quiet while Weber translated and repeated the president's German line; Kennedy was obviously relieved at the crowd's positive response and thanked Weber for his translation. Weber translated this compliment also. According to Daum, after this first successful delivery, \"Kennedy, who fiddles a bit with his suit jacket, is grinning like a boy who has just pulled off a coup.\"[3]", "There is a widespread perception that Kennedy made an embarrassing mistake by saying Ich bin ein Berliner. By not leaving out the indefinite article \"ein,\" he supposedly changed the meaning of the sentence from the intended \"I am a citizen of Berlin\" to \"I am a Berliner\" (a Berliner being a type of German pastry, similar to a jelly doughnut).", "John F. Kennedy gave a speech about the Berlin Wall in which he said, \"Ich bin ein Berliner\"\u00a0\u2013 \"I am a Berliner\"\u00a0\u2013 which meant much to a city that was a Western island in Soviet satellite territory.", "Few foreigners realize that the German term Berliner is also the vulgate idiom for a common jelly doughnut, and thus that Kennedy's seminal 'Ich bin ein Berliner' was greeted by the Teutonic crowds with a delight only apparently political.[27]", "ASCAP's records show that 25 of Berlin's songs reached the top of the charts and were re-recorded by dozens of famous singers over the years, such as Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Diana Ross, Nat King Cole and Ella Fitzgerald. In 1924, when Berlin was 36, his biography, The Story of Irving Berlin, was being written by Alexander Woollcott. In a letter to Woollcott, Jerome Kern offered what one writer said \"may be the last word\" on the significance of Irving Berlin:", "It's worth recalling, again, President John F. Kennedy's use of a German phrase while standing before the Berlin Wall. It would be great, his wordsmiths thought, for him to declare himself a symbolic citizen of Berlin. Hence, Ich bin ein Berliner. What they did not know, but could easily have found out, was that such citizens never refer to themselves as 'Berliners.' They reserve that term for a favorite confection often munched at breakfast. So, while they understood and appreciated the sentiments behind the President's impassioned declaration, the residents tittered among themselves when he exclaimed, literally, \"I am a jelly-filled doughnut.\"[17]", "The Roy Harper song \"Berliners\", from his 1990 album Once, uses the 4th stanza as its opening verse, preceded by a recording of a Remembrance Day ceremony where the same stanza was recited. The song also uses a BBC news broadcast describing the fall of the Berlin Wall.", "On June 26, 1963 Kennedy arrived in West Berlin and visited Checkpoint Charlie. On that day he delivered his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech in front of 150,000 West Germans. In remarks to his aides on Berlin Wall Kennedy noted that the wall \"is a hell of a lot better than a war\".[23]", "A German translation of My Fair Lady opened on October 1, 1961, at the Theater des Westens in Berlin, starring Karin H\u00fcbner and Paul Hubschmid (and conducted, as was the Broadway opening, by Franz Allers). Coming at the height of Cold War tensions, just weeks after the closing of the East Berlin\u2013West Berlin border and the erection of the Berlin Wall, this was the first staging of a Broadway musical in Berlin since World War II. As such it was seen as a symbol of West Berlin's cultural renaissance and resistance. Lost attendance from East Berlin (now no longer possible) was partly made up by a \"musical air bridge\" of flights bringing in patrons from West Germany, and the production was embraced by Berliners, running for two years.[37][38]", "On June 26, President Kennedy gave a public speech in West Berlin. He reiterated the American commitment to Germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience.[196] Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: \"Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.\" The speech is known for its famous phrase \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" (\"I am a citizen of Berlin\"). A million people were on the street for the speech.[196] Kennedy remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards: \"We'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live.\"[197]", "On 26 June 1963, 22 months after the erection of the Berlin Wall, U.S. President John F. Kennedy visited West Berlin.

His father, a cantor in a synagogue, uprooted the family to America, as did many other Jewish families in the late 19th century. In 1893 they settled in New York City. Upon their arrival at Ellis Island, the name \"Beilin\" was changed to \"Baline\".

The tradition of using St\u00a0Edward's Crown was revived in 1911 for the coronation of George\u00a0V.[77] In 1953, Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II opted to use a stylised image of this crown in coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia throughout the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority. It replaced the image of a Tudor-style crown which had been adopted by Edward\u00a0VII in 1901.[82]", "A much lighter crown is worn by the monarch when he or she leaves Westminster Abbey, and at the annual State Opening of Parliament.[83] The current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 for George\u00a0VI and is a virtual copy of the one made in 1838 for Queen Victoria, which had fallen into a poor state of repair,[84] and had been made using gems from its own predecessor, the State Crown of George\u00a0I.[85] In 1953, the crown was resized to fit Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II, and the arches were lowered by 2.5\u00a0cm (1.0\u00a0in) to give it a more feminine appearance.[86] It is made of gold, silver and platinum, and has four crosses patt\u00e9e and fleurs-de-lis, with two arches surmounted by a monde and cross patt\u00e9e.", "The crown is worn by the monarch on leaving Westminster Abbey at the end of his or her coronation.[17] It is also worn or carried at the annual State Opening of Parliament, although in 1974 and 2017, when snap general elections were held, Queen Elizabeth\u00c2\u00a0II chose to wear a hat. Usually, the crown is taken to the Palace of Westminster under armed guard in its own carriage and placed in the Robing Room, where the Queen dons her robes and puts on the crown before giving her speech to Parliament. If a State Opening occurs before a coronation, the crown is placed on a cushion beside the monarch. In 1689, one week after being proclaimed king, William III wore his crown in Parliament to pass the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689.[18] When not in use, the Imperial State Crown is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.", "State regalia were increasingly passed from one king to the next. The first example of this was Henry\u00a0VIII's Crown. Its date of manufacture is unknown but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. The gold crown was covered in precious stones, and its rim was decorated with alternating crosses patt\u00e9e and fleurs-de-lis.[46] Although some English monarchs laid claim to the French throne, the fleurs-de-lis on their crowns had evolved from the trefoil introduced in the 11th\u00a0century by King Canute and were purely decorative.[48] The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in law after the Union of the Crowns when James\u00a0VI and\u00a0I decreed in 1605: \"Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells [are] to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme\".[46]", "The earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in Deal, Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150\u00a0BCE. A sword, brooch, ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a single arch,[e] which sat directly on the head of its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the Mill Hill Warrior.[12] Following the Roman conquest of Britain in 43\u00a0CE (AD), crowns and other symbols of authority continued to be used by the governors of Britain. A dig in a field at Hockwold\u00a0cum\u00a0Wilton, Norfolk, in 1957 revealed a large number of circlets and a bronze crown with two arches and depictions of male faces, dating from the period of Roman occupation.[13]", "In 1953 the new Queen, Elizabeth II, decided to replace the Tudor Crown in all contexts with a representation of the actual crown generally used for British coronations, the St Edward's Crown. This new symbol therefore began to appear on the fascias of K6 kiosks.", "The British monarchy traces its origins from the petty kingdoms of early medieval Scotland and Anglo-Saxon England, which consolidated into the kingdoms of England and Scotland by the 10th century AD. In 1066, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon monarch, Harold Godwinson, was defeated and killed during the Norman conquest of England and the English monarchy passed to the Normans' victorious leader, William the Conqueror, and his descendants.", "St Edward's Crown, used to crown English monarchs, was considered to be a holy relic,[2] kept in the saint's shrine at Westminster Abbey and therefore not worn by monarchs at any other time. Instead, a \"great crown\" with crosses and fleurs-de-lis, but without arches (an open crown), was a king's usual headgear at state occasions until the time of Henry V, who is depicted wearing an imperial crown of state with gold arches (a closed crown).[3] Arches were a symbol of sovereignty, and by this point in history, the king of England was being celebrated as rex in regno suo est imperator \u2013 an emperor of his own domain \u2013 owing obedience to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers, who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.[4]", "Thus began a tradition of each queen consort having a crown made specially for her.[92] In 1902, the Crown of Queen Alexandra, a European-style crown\u00a0\u2013 flatter and with more arches than traditional British crowns\u00a0\u2013 was made for Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward\u00a0VII, to wear at their coronation. Set with over 3,000 diamonds, it was the first consort crown to include the 105-carat (21.0\u00a0g) Koh-i-Noor diamond which had been presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 following the British conquest of the Punjab.[93] The second was Queen Mary's Crown; also unusual for a British crown in having eight half-arches instead of the traditional four, the crown was made in 1911 for the coronation of Queen Mary and George\u00a0V. It contains 2,200 diamonds and has contained Cullinans\u00a0III and IV. In 1914, both Cullinan stones and the Koh-i-Noor were replaced with crystal replicas and, at the same time, the arches were made detachable so it could be worn as a circlet or open crown.[94] Mary paid for the Art Deco-inspired crown out of her own pocket and originally hoped that it would be used by future queens consort.[95]", "After George\u00a0V died, Mary continued wearing the crown (without its arches) as a queen mother, and so the Crown of Queen Elizabeth was made for Queen Elizabeth, wife of George\u00a0VI and later known as the Queen Mother, to wear at their coronation in 1937.[96] It is the only British crown to be made entirely of platinum,[94] and was modelled on Queen Mary's Crown, but has the usual four half-arches instead of eight.[97] The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, most notably the Koh-i-Noor in the middle of the front cross. It also contains a replica of the 22.5-carat (4.5\u00a0g) Lahore Diamond given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851,[98] and a 17.3-carat (3.5\u00a0g) diamond given to her by Abd\u00fclmecid\u00a0I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1856.[97] Elizabeth last wore it as an open crown at the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth II in 1953. The crown was laid on top of Elizabeth's coffin during her lying in state and funeral in 2002.[99]", "In the Jewel House there are two crowns that were not intended to be used at a coronation. Queen Victoria's Small Diamond Crown is just 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) tall, and was made in 1870 using 1,187 diamonds for Victoria to wear on top of her widow's cap. She often wore it at State Openings of Parliament in place of the much heavier Imperial State Crown. After the queen's death in 1901, Queen Alexandra wore the crown, and it was also worn by Queen Mary.[106] The Imperial Crown of India was created in 1911 when George\u00a0V visited the Delhi Durbar with Queen Mary to be proclaimed (but not crowned) as Emperor of India. Since the British constitution prohibits the removal of Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom, a new crown had to be made for the event, with emeralds, rubies, sapphires and 6,100 diamonds. It has not been used since and is now a part of the Crown Jewels.[107]", "Unlike the Crown Jewels\u2014which mainly date from the accession of Charles II\u2014the jewels are not official regalia or insignia. Much of the collection was designed for queens regnant and queens consort, though some kings have added to the collection. A few diamonds were brought to the United Kingdom from the British colonies and far away lands as the spoils of war. Most of the jewellery was purchased from other European heads of state and members of the aristocracy, or handed down by older generations of the Royal Family, often as birthday and wedding presents. In recent years, Elizabeth has worn them in her capacity as Queen of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and can be seen wearing jewels from her collection in official portraits made specially for these realms.[4]", "The transferring of crowns symbolised the transfer of power between rulers. Following the defeat in 1282 of the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd by Edward\u00a0I, the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary King Arthur, were surrendered to England. According to the Chronicle of Aberconwy Abbey, \"and so the glory of Wales and the Welsh was handed over to the kings of England\".[31] After the invasion of Scotland in 1296, the Stone of Scone was sent to the Tower of London \"in recognition\", as the chronicler Walter of Guisborough put it, \"of a kingdom surrendered and conquered\".[32] It was fitted into a wooden chair\u00a0\u2013 then known as King Edward's Chair\u00a0\u2013 which came to be used for the investiture of kings of England, earning its reputation as the Coronation Chair.[33] The Scottish regalia were also taken to London;[34] Scotland eventually regained its independence.[35] In Edward\u00a0II's treasury in 1324 there were 10 crowns.[36] When Richard\u00a0II was forced to abdicate in 1399, he symbolically handed St\u00a0Edward's Crown to Henry\u00a0IV, saying \"I present and give to you this crown \u2026 and all the rights dependent on it\".[37]", "The Imperial State Crown is one of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom and symbolises the sovereignty of the monarch.", "It has existed in various forms since the 15th\u00c2\u00a0century. The current version was made in 1937 and is worn by the monarch after a coronation (St Edward's Crown having been used to crown the monarch) and used at the annual State Opening of Parliament.", "At a coronation, the monarch is anointed using holy oil poured from an ampulla into the spoon, followed by investiture with robes and ornaments, and finally he or she is crowned with St\u00a0Edward's Crown. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are crowned as queen consort with a plainer set of regalia.[d] Since 1831, a new crown has been made specially for each queen consort. When not in use, the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, where they are seen by around 2.5\u00a0million visitors every year.", "The British crown was always a large coin, and from the 19th century it did not circulate well. However, crowns were usually struck in a new monarch's coronation year, true of each monarch since King George IV up until the present monarch in 1953, with the single exception of King George V.", "The two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later Kingdom of Great Britain). There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.", "It was fashioned to closely resemble the medieval St\u00a0Edward's Crown, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the arches are decidedly Baroque.[79] In the late 20th century, it was assumed to incorporate gold from the original, as they are almost identical in weight, and no invoice was produced in 1661 for the materials. In 2008, new research found that a coronation crown had been made in 1660, a year before Charles\u00a0II's other regalia were commissioned after Parliament increased the budget as a token of their appreciation for the king.[80]", "The coronation of the British monarch is a ceremony (specifically, initiation rite) in which the monarch of the United Kingdom is formally invested with regalia and crowned at Westminster Abbey. It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in other European monarchies, all of which have abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies.", "The quasi-official emblem of the Houses of Parliament is a crowned portcullis. The portcullis was originally the badge of various English noble families from the 14th century. It went on to be adopted by the kings of the Tudor dynasty in the 16th century, under whom the Palace of Westminster became the regular meeting place of Parliament. The crown was added to make the badge a specifically royal symbol.", "\u00c6thelstan ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In the earliest known depiction of an English king wearing a crown, he is shown presenting a copy of Bede's Life of St Cuthbert to the saint himself.[18] Until his reign, kings had been portrayed on coins wearing helmets and circlets,[19] or wreath-like diadems in the style of Roman emperor, Constantine the Great. Whether or not they wore such an item is open to question.[20] Coins are unreliable because the portraits were often generic or copied from overseas coins.[21] Edgar the Peaceful was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced into the ceremony for his coronation in 973.[22]", "The monarch of England during the Elizabethan Era was Queen Elizabeth I and her family.", "A corporation sole, the Crown is the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, and judicial governance in the monarchy of each country. These monarchies are united by the personal union of their monarch, but they are independent states. The concept of the Crown developed first in England as a separation of the literal crown and property of the nation state from the person and personal property of the monarch. It spread through English and later British colonisation and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the United Kingdom, its Crown dependencies, and the other 15 independent realms. It is not to be confused with any physical crown, such as those of the British regalia.", "The two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.", "The front of George I's State Crown, 1714", "Since the Restoration, there have been many additions and alterations to the regalia.[j] A new set of regalia was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, Charles\u00a0II having been unmarried when he took the throne.[68] Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when Mary\u00a0II was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband William\u00a0III.[52] After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest,[69] and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with paste and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice which continued until the early 20th\u00a0century.[52]", "The coin's origins lay in the English silver crown, one of many silver coins that appeared in various countries from the 16th century onwards, the most famous example perhaps being the famous Spanish pieces of eight, all of which were of a similar size and weight (approx 38mm diameter and containing approx 25\u00c2\u00a0grams of fine silver) and thus interchangeable in international trade.[2] The kingdom of England also minted gold Crowns in the 16th and 17th centuries.", "A crown referred to as St\u00a0Edward's Crown is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of Henry\u00a0III in 1220, and it appears to be the same crown worn by Edward.[28] Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king's authority.[29] The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its eventual destruction 400 years later. One of the few descriptions of St\u00a0Edward's Crown to survive, from Henry\u00a0III's time, is a \"gold crown with diverse stones\".[28] Also in the Crown Jewels in this period was an item called a state crown. Together with other crowns, rings, and swords, it comprised the monarch's non-hereditary state regalia that was kept separate from the coronation regalia, mostly at the royal palaces.[30]", "Queen Victoria's crown made in 1838", "Monarchs often pledged various items of state regalia as collateral for loans throughout the Middle Ages.[38] At some point in the 14th\u00a0century, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia.[g] The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey.[39] Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of St\u00a0Edward's Crown by the time of Henry\u00a0IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor Henry\u00a0V.[38] Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.[40]", "Crown Royal was introduced in 1939 by Samuel Bronfman, president of Seagram, as a tribute to the royal visit of King George VI and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, the first of a reigning monarch of the United Kingdom to Canada.[3][4] It was available only in Canada until 1964,[5] being introduced to the United States in the 1960s.[3]", "Spurs remade for Charles\u00a0II are taken from the altar and presented to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Known originally as St\u00a0George's Spurs, they are one of the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Gold spurs were introduced into the coronation ceremony in 1189 at the coronation of Richard\u00a0I. Historically, the spurs were fastened to the monarch's feet but since the Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens and placed on the altar.[142]", "Royal arms of Queen Elizabeth II, as used in England", "The deer represent the natural riches of the province. The Loyalist coronets at their necks honour the original British settlers in Ontario who brought with them the British parliamentary form of government. The Royal Crowns, left 1992, right 1792, recognize the parliamentary bicentennial and represent Ontario's heritage as a constitutional monarchy. They were granted as a special honour by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of the Governor General.", "George V wearing the crown in 1911", "Following the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI and I.[20] As a consequence, the Royal Arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king's new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.[10]", "Oliver Cromwell, who led the uprising and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested with many of the traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown.[56] A crown, perhaps made of gilded base metal, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.[57]", "St Edward's Crown was initially used on kiosks in all parts of the United Kingdom. However, from 1955, in Scotland, the Post Office opted to use a representation of the actual Crown of Scotland, in line with a wider policy for government agencies in Scotland. To accommodate the two different designs of crown on K6 kiosks, the fascia sections were henceforth cast with a slot in them, into which a plate bearing the appropriate crown was inserted before the roof section was fitted.", "Use of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to its early history. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12th\u00a0century. By the Tudor period it was usual for a monarch to inherit state regalia from his or her predecessor. Most of the present collection as a whole dates from around 350 years ago when King Charles\u00a0II ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been either sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649, during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon, which is the oldest object in the collection, and three early 17th-century swords.", "Crowns are the main symbols of royal authority.[21]", "The Sovereign's Ring has been used by all monarchs from William\u00a0IV in 1831 to Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II, with the exception of Queen Victoria, whose fingers were too small to retain it.[68] In the centre of the gold ring is an octagonal sapphire overlaid with a square ruby and four long, narrow rubies forming a cross. Around the sapphire are 14 brilliant diamonds.[154] The general design is intended to represent the red Cross of St\u00a0George on the blue background of St\u00a0Andrew's Cross.[144] A small copy of the ring was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter: \"The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the greatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with great pain\".[155] In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers.[156] In 1919, it was deposited at the Tower of London along with the Sovereign's Ring and Queen Consort's Ring, which has been worn by all wives of kings from Queen Adelaide onwards.[157]", "Following the death of James\u00a0I in 1625, Charles\u00a0I succeeded the throne. His many conflicts with Parliament, stemming from his belief in the divine right of kings and the many religious conflicts that pervaded his reign, triggered the English Civil War.[49] Parliament viewed the regalia as \"Jewels of the Crown\", vested in the monarch because of his public role, and not owned by him in a personal capacity.[50] To avoid putting his own subjects at risk, Charles exported many of the state regalia, including the Mirror of Great Britain, to customers and pawn brokers in Amsterdam. In 1642, on learning of the king's scheme, both Houses of Parliament declared all traffickers of the Crown Jewels to be enemies of the state.[51]", "All these crowns are on display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London with crystal replicas of the diamond set in the older crowns.[48] The original bracelet given to Queen Victoria can also be seen there. A glass model of the Koh-i-Noor shows visitors how it looked when it was brought to the United Kingdom. Replicas of the diamond in this and its re-cut forms can also be seen in the 'Vault' exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London.[49]", "From 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.[224] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. The Queen also possesses royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.[225]", "Before 1831, each monarch generally received a new ring to symbolise his or her \"marriage\" to the nation.[68] An exception was the Stuart Coronation Ring, probably used at the English coronations of Charles\u00a0I and Charles\u00a0II, and certainly that of James\u00a0II, who took the ring to France after the Glorious Revolution. It returned to the United Kingdom 100 years later and is now part of the Royal Collection of Gems and Jewels. The gold ring has a large ruby etched with a Cross of St\u00a0George and bordered by 26 diamonds that were applied in the 19th century.[152] Rubies symbolise all the kingly virtues and have featured on coronation rings since the early Middle Ages.[153] Since 1830, the ring has been on permanent loan from Windsor Castle to Edinburgh Castle, where it is displayed with the Honours of Scotland.[152]", "Until 1927, the monarch's royal title included the words \"of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". In 1927, the words \"United Kingdom\" were removed from the royal title so that the monarch was instead styled as \"King/Queen of Great Britain, Ireland...[and other places]\". The words \"United Kingdom\" were restored to the monarch's title in 1953 with the reference to \"Ireland\" replaced with a reference to \"Northern Ireland\".[citation needed]", "The Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, originally the Crown Jewels of England, are 140 royal ceremonial objects kept in the Tower of London, which include the regalia and vestments worn by British kings and queens at their coronations.[c]", "Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, a new state crown was made for Charles II by Sir Robert Vyner. About 10 versions of the crown have existed since the restoration.[9] The one made for Queen Victoria in 1838 is the basis for today's crown. Made by Rundell and Bridge in 1838 using old and new jewels, it had a crimson velvet cap with ermine border and a lining of white silk. It weighed 39.25 troy ounces (43.06\u00a0oz; 1,221\u00a0g) and was decorated with 1,363 brilliant-cut, 1,273 rose-cut and 147 table-cut diamonds, 277 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, 4 rubies, and the Black Prince's Ruby (a spinel).[10] At the State Opening of Parliament in 1845, the Duke of Argyll was carrying the crown before Queen Victoria when it fell off the cushion and broke. Victoria wrote in her diary, \"it was all crushed and squashed like a pudding that had sat down\".[11]", "Members of the British Royal Family have coronets on their coats of arms, and may wear them at coronations. They are according to regulations made by King Charles II in 1661 shortly after his return from exile in France (getting a taste for its lavish court style; Louis XIV started monumental work at Versailles that year) and Restoration, and vary depending upon the prince's relationship to the Monarch.

This was a method that had been described previously, by Cennino Cennini in the 14th century. However, Cennini had recommended the use of secco for the final touches alone.[14] These techniques were important for Leonardo's desire to work slowly on the painting, giving him sufficient time to develop the gradual shading or chiaroscuro that was essential in his style.", "Paintings on the life of Abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: the sacrifice of Isaac; meeting Melchizedek; entertaining the three angels; Hagar in the desert; and a few others.[38] Additionally, Martin O'Kane, a professor of Biblical Studies, writes that the parable of Lazarus resting in the \"Bosom of Abraham\", as described in the Gospel of Luke, became an iconic image in Christian works.[39] According to O'Kane, artists often chose to divert from the common literary portrayal of Lazarus sitting next to Abraham at a banquet in Heaven and instead focus on the \"somewhat incongruous notion of Abraham, the most venerated of patriarchs, holding a naked and vulnerable child in his bosom\".[39] Several artists have been inspired by the life of Abraham, including Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528), Caravaggio (1573\u20131610), Donatello, Raphael, Philip van Dyck (Dutch painter, 1680\u20131753), and Claude Lorrain (French painter, 1600\u20131682). Rembrandt (Dutch, 1606\u20131669) created at least seven works on Abraham, Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) did several, Marc Chagall did at least five on Abraham, Gustave Dor\u00e9 (French illustrator, 1832\u20131883) did six, and James Tissot (French painter and illustrator, 1836\u20131902) did over twenty works on the subject.[38]", "Later, during The Renaissance and Counter-Reformation, Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of Western art \u2013 often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's David and Piet\u00e0 sculptures, to Da Vinci's Last Supper and Raphael's various Madonna paintings. Referring to a \"great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660\", Kenneth Clarke wrote:[64]", "Martin Luther in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the \"ancient, apostolic church\".[2] The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical Andreas Karlstadt. For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like the Last Supper by the younger Cranach were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend Lucas Cranach, to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional depiction of Jesus. As such, \"Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.\"[1] Lutherans proudly employed the use of the crucifix as it highlighted their high view of the Theology of the Cross.[2][6] Stories grew up of \"indestructible\" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention.[7] Thus, for Lutherans, \"the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.\"[8]", "While James Beck became \"embroiled in a public debate\" with Gianluigi Colalucci, Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, started a petition supported by 15 well-known artists including Robert Motherwell, George Segal, Robert Rauschenberg, Christo and Andy Warhol asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.[16]", "According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is today called The Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion, just outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, and is traditionally known as The Upper Room. This is based on the account in the Synoptic Gospels that states that Jesus had instructed two disciples (Luke 22:8 specifies that Jesus sent Peter and John) to go to \"the city\" to meet \"a man carrying a jar of water\", who would lead them to a house, where they would find \"a large upper room furnished and ready\".[Mark 14:13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15] In this upper room they \"prepare the Passover\".", "The Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the Protestant Reformation Christian art continued to be produced in great quantities, both for churches and clergy and for the laity. During this time, Michelangelo Buonarroti painted the Sistine Chapel and carved the famous Piet\u00e0, Gianlorenzo Bernini created the massive columns in St. Peter's Basilica, and Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Last Supper. The Reformation had a huge effect on Christian art, rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.", "At the Last Supper (set outdoors in a garden setting during the day), Jesus reveals that he knows Peter (Toubus) will deny him and Judas will betray him. A bitter argument between Jesus and Judas ensues, in which Judas berates Jesus for destroying their hopes and ideals and threatens to ruin Jesus' ambition by staying there without helping him to reach the Glory; Jesus tells Judas to leave and Judas finally runs off (\"The Last Supper\"). As the apostles fall asleep, Jesus goes to Gethsemane to pray about his imminent death and reluctantly agrees to go forward with God's plan (\"Gethsemane [I Only Want to Say]\"). Jesus waits for Judas, who arrives, accompanied by guards, and betrays him with a kiss. The disciples offer to fight the guards, but Jesus will not allow it. Jesus is taken to Caiaphas' house, found guilty of blasphemy and sent to Pilate (\"The Arrest\"). Peter, meanwhile, fearfully denies Jesus three times after being accused of being one of Jesus' followers (\"Peter's Denial\"). Jesus is taken to Pilate's house, where the governor, unaware that Jesus is the man from his dream, mocks him. Since he does not deal with Jews, Pilate sends him to Herod (\"Pilate and Christ\"). The flamboyant King Herod is excited to finally meet Jesus, for he has heard the hype. He tries to persuade Jesus to perform various miracles. When Jesus refuses to answer, Herod orders the guards to take him back to Pilate (\"Herod's Song [Try It and See]\").", "In common with other depictions of the Last Supper from this period, Leonardo seats the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them has his back to the viewer. Most previous depictions excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus, or placing halos around all the disciples except Judas.", "Santa Maria delle grazie (\"Holy Mary of Grace\") is a church and Dominican convent in Milan, northern Italy, included in the UNESCO World Heritage sites list.

His successor, Paul III, was instrumental in seeing that Michelangelo began and completed the project, which he laboured on from 1534 to October 1541.[36] The fresco depicts the Second Coming of Christ and his Judgement of the souls. Michelangelo ignored the usual artistic conventions in portraying Jesus, showing him as a massive, muscular figure, youthful, beardless and naked.[48] He is surrounded by saints, among whom Saint Bartholomew holds a drooping flayed skin, bearing the likeness of Michelangelo.

The Army of Northern Virginia now comprised a total of 75,054 soldiers at the Battle of Gettysburg.[16]", "Arkansas formed 48 infantry regiments and over 20 cavalry regiments and 20 artillery batteries for the Confederate States Army. Most of the troops raised in Arkansas before May 1862 were transferred east of the Mississippi River and would eventually comprise a division in the Confederate Army of Tennessee. All but one infantry regiment and all of the cavalry and artillery units served most of the war in what was known as the \"Western Theater\", where there were few battles that were on the scale of those in the \"Eastern Theater\". Beginning in 1862, the Confederate States west of the Mississippi River were assigned to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi. All of the new unit raised and organized after May 1862 would remain in the Trans-Mississippi for the remainder of the war. One infantry regiment, the \"Third Arkansas\", served in the eastern theater for the duration of the war, thus making it the state's most celebrated Confederate military unit. Attached to General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, the \"Third Arkansas\" would take part in almost every major Eastern battle, including the Battle of Seven Pines, Seven Days Battle, Battle of Harper's Ferry, Battle of Antietam, Battle of Fredericksburg, Battle of Gettysburg, Battle of Chickamauga, Battle of the Wilderness, and the Appomattox Campaign.[30][31]", "Considerably more Confederate forces were on the way, however. Two divisions of the Second Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, were approaching Gettysburg from the north, from the towns of Carlisle and York. The five brigades of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes marched down the Carlisle Road but left it before reaching town to advance down the wooded crest of Oak Ridge, where they could link up with the left flank of Hill's Corps. The four brigades under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early approached on the Harrisburg Road. Union cavalry outposts north of the town detected both movements. Ewell's remaining division (Maj. Gen.

Pegram.[5] Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5\u00c2\u00a0km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first shot of the battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic.[6] Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.[7]", "To the left of Bartlett, the Iron Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler, advanced through woods south of the field and struck a brigade of Alabamians commanded by Brig. Gen. Cullen A. Battle. Although initially pushed back, the Confederates counterattacked with the brigade of Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon, tearing through the line and forcing the Iron Brigade (now filled with green recruits from its devastating losses at Gettysburg) to break for the first time in its history. As the majority of the new recruits fled from the terrors of combat, the old veterans of the brigade attempted to hold their ground and eventually were forced to retreat against overwhelming odds.[25]", "The entire force that stepped off toward the Union positions at about 2 p.m.[17] consisted of about 12,500 men.[26] Although the attack is popularly called a \"charge\", the men marched deliberately in line, to speed up and then charge only when they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy. The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600\u00a0m) front. The Confederates encountered heavy artillery fire while advancing nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line and were slowed by fences in their path. Initially sloping down, the terrain changed to a gentle upward incline approximately midway between the lines. These obstacles played a large role in the increasing number of casualties the advancing Confederates faced. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers. As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting \"Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!\" in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg. Fire from Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery's concealed artillery positions north of Little Round Top raked the Confederate right flank, while the artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to canister and musket fire as the Confederates came within 400\u00a0yards of the Union line. The mile-long front shrank to less than half a mile (800\u00a0m) as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire.[27]", "In addition to Virginians, it included regiments from all over the Confederacy, some from as far away as Georgia, Texas and Arkansas. One of the most well known was the Texas Brigade, made up of the 1st, 4th, and 5th Texas, and the 3rd Arkansas, which distinguished themselves in numerous battles, such as during their fight for the Devil's Den at the Battle of Gettysburg.", "Although the assault is known to popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.[10]", "In addition to being the deadliest battle of the war in terms of total casualties, Gettysburg also had the highest number of Generals killed in action of any battle in the war. The Confederacy lost generals Paul Jones Semmes, William Barksdale, Richard Garnett, and Lewis Armistead, as well as J. Johnston Pettigrew during the retreat after the battle. The Union lost Generals John Reynolds, Samuel K. Zook, Stephen H. Weed, and Elon J. Farnsworth, as well as Strong Vincent, who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. Additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of Union Generals Dan Sickles (lost a leg), Francis C. Barlow, and Winfield Scott Hancock. For the Confederacy, Major General John Bell Hood lost the use of his left arm, while Major General Henry Heth received a shot to the head on the first day of battle (though incapacitated for the rest of the battle, he remarkably survived without long term injuries, credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches). Confederate Generals James Kemper and Isaac R. Trimble were severely wounded during Pickett's charge and captured during the Confederate retreat. General James J. Archer, in command of a brigade that most likely was responsible for killing Reynolds, was taken prisoner shortly after Reynolds' death.", "Overall, the state raised some 15,000 troops for the Confederacy, which were organized into twelve regiments of infantry and two of cavalry, as well as several artillery batteries and supporting units. Since neither army aggressively sought control of Florida, many of Florida's troops were sent to serve in Virginia in the Army of Northern Virginia under Brig. Gen. Edward A. Perry and Col. David Lang. The \"Florida Brigade\" fought in many of Robert E. Lee's campaigns, and twice charged Cemetery Ridge during the Battle of Gettysburg, including supporting Pickett's Charge.", "Series IV \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Confederate Authorities", "The Gettysburg National Military Park protects and interprets the landscape of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.

Strong Vincent. The 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commanded by Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, fought the most famous engagement there, culminating in a dramatic downhill bayonet charge that is one of the most well-known actions at Gettysburg and in the American Civil War.", "Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south.[14]", "The armies stared at one another in a heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, the same day that the Vicksburg garrison surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.[90]", "The target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union Army of the Potomac's II Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning.)[7] To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays, and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps, including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.[6]", "As the Union troops climbed Cemetery Hill, they encountered the determined Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock. At midday, Gen. Meade was nine miles (14\u00c2\u00a0km) south of Gettysburg in Taneytown, Maryland, when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. He immediately dispatched Hancock, commander of the II Corps and his most trusted subordinate, to the scene with orders to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle. (Meade's original plan had been to man a defensive line on Pipe Creek, a few miles south in Maryland. But the serious battle underway was making that a difficult option.)[61]", "On the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army.[15]", "The first day at Gettysburg\u2014more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days\u2014ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.[69] Union casualties were almost 9,000, Confederate slightly more than 6,000.[70]", "The brigade took pride in its designation, \"1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps\", under which it played a prominent role in the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. It repulsed the first Confederate offensive through Herbst's Woods, capturing much of Brig. Gen. James J. Archer's brigade, and Archer himself. The 6th Wisconsin (along with 100 men of the brigade guard) are remembered for their famous charge on an unfinished railroad cut north and west of the town, where they captured the flag of the 2nd Mississippi and took hundreds of Confederate prisoners.[5]", "The nature of the result of the Battle of Gettysburg has been the subject of controversy for years[when?]. Although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the \"turning point\", usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day.[13] This is based on the observation that after Gettysburg Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives\u2014his army merely reacted to the initiative of Ulysses S. Grant in 1864 and 1865\u2014and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.[102]", "During the Civil War the Confederates had their own version:", "The two armies began to collide at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863. The first day proceeded in three phases as combatants continued to arrive at the battlefield. In the morning, two brigades of Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division (of Hill's Third Corps) were delayed by dismounted Union cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. John Buford. As infantry reinforcements arrived under Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds from the I Corps, the Confederate assaults down the Chambersburg Pike were repulsed, although Gen. Reynolds was killed. By early afternoon, the Union XI Corps had arrived, and the Union position was in a semicircle from west to north of the town. Ewell's Second Corps began a massive assault from the north, with Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division attacking across the open fields north of town. The Union lines generally held under extremely heavy pressure, although the salient at Barlow's Knoll was overrun. The third phase of the battle came as Rodes renewed his assault from the north and Heth returned with his entire division from the west, accompanied by the division of Maj. Gen. W. Dorsey Pender. Heavy fighting in Herbst's Woods (near the Lutheran Theological Seminary) and on Oak Ridge finally caused the Union line to collapse. Some of the Federals conducted a fighting withdrawal through the town, suffering heavy casualties and losing many prisoners; others simply retreated. They took up good defensive positions on Cemetery Hill and waited for additional attacks. Despite discretionary orders from Robert E. Lee to take the heights \"if practicable,\" Richard Ewell chose not to attack. Historians have debated ever since how the battle might have ended differently if he had found it practicable to do so.[63]", "Leading off the fourth attack of the day against the sunken road was the Irish Brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas F. Meagher. As they advanced with emerald green flags snapping in the breeze, a regimental chaplain, Father William Corby, rode back and forth across the front of the formation shouting words of conditional absolution prescribed by the Roman Catholic Church for those who were about to die. (Corby would later perform a similar service at Gettysburg in 1863.) The mostly Irish immigrants lost 540 men to heavy volleys before they were ordered to withdraw.[52]", "At the start of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863, Doubleday's division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of Brigadier General John Buford. When his corps commander, Major General John F. Reynolds, was killed very early in the fighting, Doubleday found himself in command of the corps at 10:50 am. His men fought well in the morning, putting up a stout resistance, but as overwhelming Confederate forces massed against them, their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of Gettysburg to the relative safety of Cemetery Hill south of town. It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. Seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent, indicating the ferocity of the Union defense. On Cemetery Hill, however, the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty, and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle; it would be decommissioned in March 1864, its surviving units consolidated into other corps.[4]", "The 14th Indiana Infantry Regiment was nicknamed the \"Gibralter Brigade\" for maintaining its position at the Battle of Antietam. It secured Cemetery Hill on the first day of the three-day fight at the Battle of Gettysburg, where it lost 123 of its men.[60] The 19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, part of the Iron Brigade, made critical contributions to some of the most important engagements of the war, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, but was almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Gettysburg, where it sustained 210 casualties.[61][62] The 19th Indiana suffered the heaviest battle losses of any Indiana unit; 15.9 percent of its men were killed or mortally wounded during the war.[31][63] The 27th Indiana Infantry Regiment earned the nickname \"giants in the cornfield\" at the Battle of Antietam.[31] The regiment also fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, and in the Atlanta Campaign. The 27th Indiana's casualties were 15.3 percent of its total enrollment, nearly as many as the 19th Indiana.[63]", "The Army of the Potomac was also the name given to General P. G. T. Beauregard's Confederate army during the early stages of the war (namely, First Bull Run; thus, the losing Union Army ended up adopting the name of the winning Confederate army). However, the name was eventually changed to the Army of Northern Virginia, which became famous under General Robert E. Lee.", "The basic unit of operational maneuver for Union forces in the Vicksburg campaign was the corps. For the Confederates, it was the division (there being no corps echelon in Pemberton's order of battle). On the battlefield, the brigade was the basic tactical unit for both sides. (One obvious exception to this rule was the battle of Raymond, where the Confederate force was a single brigade, and the brigade commander deployed and maneuvered regiments.)", "When Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on June 30, they noticed Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.[29]", "Beauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army.[64] Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition, but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory.[18] Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: \"Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. (Signed) JORDAN, Adjutant-General.\"[65]", "It was an engagement between Confederate and Union forces during the American Civil War. The battle resulted in a Confederate victory and led directly to the official establishing of a Confederate Arizona Territory, consisting of the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory. The victory paved the way for the Confederate New Mexico Campaign the following year.", "Reynolds was ordered to conduct a spoiling attack south of the turnpike and encountered Longstreet's men, causing him to call off his demonstration. Pope dismissed Reynolds's concern as a case of mistaken identity, insisting that Reynolds had run into Porter's V Corps, preparing to attack Jackson's flank. Jesse Reno ordered a IX Corps brigade under Col. James Nagle to attack the center of Jackson's line again. This time Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade was driven back from the railroad embankment, but Confederate counterattacks restored the line and pursued Nagle's troops back into the open fields until Union artillery halted their advance.[47]", "Starting in 1868, the ceremonies and Memorial Day address at Gettysburg National Park became nationally known.

The wooden dialogue and stiff animation was also mentioned.[17] Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Alec believed that Alistair, along with Shale, brought needed levity to the otherwise grim world of Dragon Age, describing the both of them as the game's most vital voices.[18] Mike Fahey, writing for Kotaku, praised Alistair as having some of the most amusing lines in the game during his review of Origins. Fahey particularly praised Steve Valentine's voice acting, calling Alistair's voice his favourite in the game and noting that many of Alistair's lines would have fallen flat were it not for Valentine's timing.[19] During an interview with Ray Muzyka (the co-founder and CEO of BioWare), VideoGamer.com's interviewer said that while he didn't like Alistair at first he grew to like him and his humour, although Muzyka himself did not like the character.[20] Kirk Hamilton, also writing for Kotaku, called Alistair one of his favorite characters, and looked forward to seeing how he got on with the \"worldly\" Isabella during The Silent Grove.[21] John Walker, writing for PC Gamer, believed that his friendship with Alistair had an \"echo of reality\", and felt that his sarcasm plus balancing his emotions and bravado \"continue[d] to resonate\".[22] Walker also praised the conversations he had with Morrigan.[22] Meer felt that Alistair and Morrigan's bickering evoked sexual tension, wishing they would just \"get it on\".[16] Kieron from Rock, Paper, Shotgun also wished to be able to set them up together.[18]", "Alistair was mainly written by David Gaider\u2014the lead writer of Origins\u2014and is voiced by Steve Valentine.[6] Alistair is a relatively new Grey Warden,[7] who are a group devoted to fighting darkspawn.

Baez has stated that the lyrics refer to her relationship with Bob Dylan.[1]", "Lyrically, \"Diamonds\" is a departure from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs,[25] and contains a prominent concept of love.[26] The first verse introduces the song's concept: \"Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky.\" The hook continues this metaphor: \"So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive.\"[27] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as \"I choose to be happy\" and \"We're like diamonds in the sky\".[25] James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line \"When you hold me, I'm alive\", and admits \"I knew that we'd become one right away\".[28] Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, \"When you hold me, I'm alive,\" and \"At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes.\"[29] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.[30]", "The song is perhaps most famously performed by Marilyn Monroe in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.

When Richards and Jagger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. Bono realised that U2 \"had no tradition\", and he felt as if they \"were from outer space\". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song \"Silver and Gold\", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood.[38] It was re-recorded by U2 for the \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour.[39] The song was described by Musician as \"tough and raw, with Bono in husky and confident voice, underpinned by a sinuous bass line, and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues-based guitar.\"[34] \"Silver and Gold\" was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times, one performance of which was featured on the band's 1988 album and rockumentary, Rattle and Hum. Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree.[40] The studio version was also included on the limited edition B-sides bonus disk of the band's first compilation album, The Best of 1980\u20131990.[41]", "Songs by Andrews have been featured in several television series, among them: \"Tell That Devil\", cowritten with Emery Dobyns and Matthew Mayfield,[11] was performed by Hayden Panettiere in Nashville and is the theme song for Wynonna Earp; \"Lost It All\", cowritten with Matthew Bronleewe,[12] was included in Teen Wolf and The Originals; and \"Rust or Gold\", cowritten with Elise Hayes,[13] in Grey's Anatomy and Beauty & the Beast. \"Rust or Gold\" was released as a single concurrent with its debut on Grey's Anatomy and within two days ranked in the top ten of iTunes' Singer/Songwriter chart.[14]", "\"Diamonds\" is the second single by Herb Alpert from his Keep Your Eye on Me album.

The lyric \"God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight\" was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as \"the song is about censorship, and they censored [it].\"[33]", "With the return of Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever, the guitar made a comeback along with a full orchestral version during a hovercraft sequence. On the soundtrack this track is named \"Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd/Bond to Holland.\"", "In 2008, Diamond gave filmmaker Greg Kohs permission to use his songs in a documentary. Kohs, a director from Philadelphia, had met a popular Milwaukee, Wisconsin, duo, Lightning & Thunder, composed of Mike Sardina, who did a Diamond impersonation, and his wife Claire. Kohs followed them for eight years and produced the film Song Sung Blue, but he needed permission to use Diamond's songs. The movie was sent to the singer in January 2008, at the recommendation of Eddie Vedder, a supporter of the film and of the duo. Though Sardina had died in 2006, Diamond invited his widow and her family to be his front-row guests at his show in Milwaukee, where he told them he was moved by the film.[83]", "\"Diamonds Are For Roger\"", "The song is a young man's reflection of a relationship that had failed. He recalls how simple things used to be between the two, recalling the simplicity of such things as \"burgers and fries and cherry pies,\" hand-holding walks along the beach and drive-in movies on moonlit nights, all before things changed between the two and he doesn't know why. He then notes he wishes things could go back to the way they were before. The song was later featured in the 1997 thriller film Breakdown, starring Kurt Russell.", "\"Diamonds and Pearls\" is the title track to Prince and The New Power Generation's 1991 hit album.[3] The song is an upbeat ballad, given a rock edge with guitar and heavy drumming. The song also features the vocals of NPG member Rosie Gaines. The ballad is an expression of love and not lust, as is the theme on some of the other singles from the album. The song was a top 10 hit, reaching number 3 in the US and the top spot on the R&B chart. The infamous pearls in the music video come from Connie Parente, a Los Angeles jewelry collector and designer.[4]", "The song tells the story of Brother Love, an evangelist who travels from town to town preaching. In the middle of the song, Diamond gives a sermon in typical evangelical style.", "The song follows what would become trademark Brian May themes such as coming-of-age, nostalgia over the loss of childhood to the past, and the difficulties of life as an adult.

The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it's about love.\"[9]", "The song was conceived and written as a tribute and remembrance to their former band member Syd Barrett; the title of the song itself can also be seen as a reference to Barrett (Shine On You Crazy Diamond). The work was first performed on their 1974 French tour and recorded for their 1975 concept album Wish You Were Here.

Locations included Honolulu's Chinatown, and at the Kualoa Ranch and Waikane Valley (Ohulehule Forest Conservancy) on Oahu.[42][43] In mid-January 2016, filming started in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.[44][45]", "Filming began on May 21, 1967, and ended on August 10, 1967. Most of the early scenes of a desert-like terrain were shot in northern Arizona near the Grand Canyon, the Colorado River, Lake Powell,[11]:61 Glen Canyon[11]:61 and other locations near Page, Arizona[11]:59 Most scenes of the ape village, interiors and exteriors, were filmed on the Fox Ranch[11]:68 in Malibu Creek State Park, northwest of Los Angeles, essentially the backlot of 20th Century Fox. The concluding beach scenes were filmed on a stretch of California seacoast between Malibu and Oxnard with cliffs that towered 130 feet above the shore. Reaching the beach on foot was virtually impossible, so cast, crew, film equipment, and even horses had to be lowered in by helicopter.[11]:79 The home movies of Roddy McDowall (on YouTube) show makeup, the Ape Village set and the beach site/set - a wooden ramp was built around the point from Westward Beach to Pirates Cove for access to the beach set. The remains of the Statue of Liberty were shot in a secluded cove on the far eastern end of Westward Beach, between Zuma Beach and Point Dume in Malibu.[13] As noted in the documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes,[9] the special effect shot of the half-buried statue was achieved by seamlessly blending a matte painting with existing cliffs. The shot looking down at Taylor was done from a 70-foot scaffold, angled over a 1/2-scale papier-mache model of the Statue. The actors in Planet of the Apes were so affected by their roles and wardrobe that, when not shooting, they automatically segregated themselves with the species they were portraying.[14]", "Principal outdoor photography for The Day the Earth Stood Still was shot on the 20th Century Fox sound stages and on its studio back lot (now located in Century City, California), with a second unit shooting background plates and other scenes in Washington D.C. and at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. The shooting schedule was from April 9 to May 23, 1951. The primary actors never travelled to Washington for the making of the film. Director Robert Wise indicated in the DVD commentary that the War Department refused participation in the film based on a reading of the script. The military equipment shown, however, came from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment then stationed at Ft. Meade which supplied the vehicles, equipment and soldiers for the segments depicting Army operations.[16] One of the tanks in the film bears the \"Brave Rifles\" insignia of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.[17]", "During production, the film was referred to as RKO 281. Most of the filming took place in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood.[51] There was some location filming at Balboa Park in San Diego and the San Diego Zoo.[52]", "After seeing his cut of Dawn, 20th Century Fox and Chernin Entertainment signed Matt Reeves to return as director for a third installment of the reboot series. On January 6, 2014, Fox announced Reeves to direct as well as co-write along with Bomback, with a planned July 2016 release. Peter Chernin, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver will produce.[75] In January 2015, Fox delayed the release to July 14, 2017.[76][77] On May 14, 2015, the title was given as War of the Planet of the Apes.[78] In August 2015, Deadline reported that Gabriel Chavarria was cast as one of the humans in the film.[79] In September 2015, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Woody Harrelson had been cast as the film's antagonist, and that Chavarria's role was small.[80] In October 2015, The Wrap reported that Steve Zahn was cast as a new ape in the film, retitled as War for the Planet of the Apes.[81]", "The movie was filmed entirely in Australia. Scenes were filmed in and around Warrnambool and Apollo Bay, Victoria.[7]", "Filming locations included Glendale, Pomona, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Burbank, Cabazon (at the Cabazon Dinosaurs[10]), Port Hueneme, California, and San Antonio, Texas.[11] Burton and Reubens had tensions with Warner Bros. studio executives over the shooting schedule.[12] Burton hired CalArts classmate Rick Heinrichs for scenes involving stop-motion animation.[12]", "Location used for the Great Pit of Carkoon scene [25][26]\nAdditional footage for the special edition of A New Hope of stormtroopers finding evidence of droids was shot here and cut in with original shots from La Grande Dune, Tunisia [27][28]", "Principal photography began in August 2011 in Louisiana.[22][45] On November 22, 2011, a crew member died in an accident at a New Orleans warehouse that was serving as a soundstage for the production. The incident happened while crew members were changing out a set.[46] The battle on the Himalayas was shot in a New Orleans warehouse previously used to build NASA rockets, that had been fitted with a green screen wall at a very steep angle with a lot of rigging above to swing the stunt people through.[47]", "In the 2017 film, War for the Planet of the Apes, a human soldier's helmet has the title of the film written on it.", "On February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and M*A*S*H director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film How Green Was My Valley (1941) and the Planet of the Apes television series (1974) were filmed, among other productions.", "A majority of the filming in New Orleans took place at Big Easy Studios inside NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility complex in East New Orleans.[187][11][157] Interior scenes, including the visitor's center, control room, and laboratories, were shot at the Michoud facility.[15] Jack Horner helped designed the educational displays in the Jurassic World visitor center.[188] Approximately 200 extras, acting as park guests sitting on bleachers, were doused with large amounts of water as part of a scene depicting the Mosasaurus feeding show,[15] which was shot on an outdoor set at the Michoud facility.[189] The raptor enclosure, a 20-foot-high outdoor structure built out in an octagonal shape, was also constructed at the Michoud facility.[11][188] One jungle scene was shot on a soundstage in Louisiana, while the rest were previously shot in Hawaii.[15] On June 30, 2014, Robinson, Simpkins, and Greer filmed scenes at Louis Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans.[190] In July 2014, fake snow was used for scenes shot in New Orleans that depicted Zach and Gray's house in Wisconsin.[191][192] An evacuation scene was filmed at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans,[185] while swamp scenes were filmed in Slidell, Louisiana.[193]", "The script was originally written by Rod Serling, but underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began.[4] Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached, but the film's producer Arthur P. Jacobs, upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston, chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film. Schaffner's changes included an ape society less advanced\u2014and therefore less expensive to depict\u2014than that of the original novel.[3] Filming took place between May 21 and August 10, 1967, in California, Utah and Arizona, with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The film's final \"closed\" cost was $5.8 million.", "Half the film was scheduled to shoot on five sound stages at Los Angeles:[54] Downey, Sony, Warner Bros., Paramount and Universal.[33] Filming moved to Chandler Field in Fresno, California, substituting for Mexico City International Airport, on October 11, 2007.[55] After shooting aerial shots of Chandler Airport and a DC-3 on the morning of October 12, 2007, filming wrapped.[56][57] Although he originally found no need for re-shoots after viewing his first cut of the film,[47] Spielberg decided to add an establishing shot filmed on February 29, 2008, in Pasadena, California.[58]", "The first stage of production started with 78 days at Elstree Studios in England,[26] where the film occupied all nine stages. The shoot commenced with a scene later deleted from the finished film where the heroes get caught in a sandstorm as they leave Tatooine.[20] (This was the only major sequence cut from the film during editing.)[21] While attempting to film Luke Skywalker's battle with the rancor beast, Lucas insisted on trying to create the scene in the same style as Toho's Godzilla films by using a stunt performer inside a suit. The production team made several attempts, but were unable to create an adequate result. Lucas eventually relented and decided to film the rancor as a high-speed puppet.[14] In April, the crew moved to the Yuma Desert in Arizona for two weeks of Tatooine exteriors.[20] Production then moved to the redwood forests of northern California[28] near Crescent City where two weeks were spent shooting the Endor forest exteriors, and then concluded at ILM in San Rafael, California for about ten days of bluescreen shots. One of two \"skeletal\" post-production units shooting background matte plates spent a day in Death Valley.[26] The other was a special Steadicam unit shooting forest backgrounds from June 15\u201317, 1982, for the speeder chase near the middle of the film.[29] Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown personally operated these shots as he walked through a disguised path inside the forest shooting at less than one frame per second. By walking at about 5\u00a0mph (8\u00a0km/h) and projecting the footage at 24 frame/s, the motion seen in the film appeared as if it were moving at around 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h).[14]", "Malick and Toll shot for 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 days in the Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the historic battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there:[11] As director of photography John Toll put it, \"It's still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense\".[12] The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia.[13] Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.", "Principal photography began on March 18, 2013, in Vancouver, under the working title of \"Nautilus,\"[110] with scenes shot at the Vancouver Convention Centre,[115] inside BC Place, and at Hi-View Lookout in Cypress Provincial Park, West Vancouver (as San Francisco's Bay Area Park). This was followed by filming in the Richmond neighborhood of Steveston. A large battle scene was shot on Moncton St, involving approximately 200 soldiers and many military vehicles. Another scene was filmed at the fisherman's wharf along Finn Slough. Additional shooting took place on Vancouver Island, around Nanaimo[116] and Victoria in British Columbia. Additional filming involving extras took place around industrial areas of Coquitlam, British Columbia.[117]", "Outside North America, War for the Planet of the Apes is receiving a scattered release in a span of three months (July\u2013September). The film began its release in about a third of the marketplace on July 14, albeit only in two major markets, and was projected to have an opening of $50\u201360 million, with the potential to go higher if smaller Asian markets over-perform, as they have for recent tent poles.[4] The film ended up having an international debut of $44.2 million, including $9.27 million in the United Kingdom.[62]", "While the rest of the film was shot in various locales throughout southern California, the filmmakers had hoped to capture this climactic sequence near the actual location of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Owing to scheduling and budget constraints, however, the finale of the film was relegated to a rural area outside Los Angeles.", "Fox approved Battle for the Planet of the Apes with a $1.2 million budget, the lowest of the series.[44] The filmmakers went into the project knowing it would be the last of the series.[45] J. Lee Thompson returned as director. Series writer Paul Dehn submitted a treatment, but illness forced him to leave the film before completing the script. The producers subsequently hired John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington to write the screenplay.[46][47] Battle continued Conquest's focus on racial conflict and domination, but, likely based in part on the studio's wishes, the Corringtons discarded Dehn's pessimistic treatment in favor of a story with a more hopeful, though ambiguous, resolution.[48]", "Fox was confident enough in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes that the studio started planning for the next installment months before the film debuted. After Fox and Chernin Entertainment screened Matt Reeves' cut of Dawn, he was contracted to return as director; he also wrote the script with Mark Bomback. Peter Chernin, Dylan Clark, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver again served as producers.[93][94] Given a $150 million budget, War for the Planet of the Apes was released on July 14, 2017.[95][96]", "The opening scene in the Peruvian jungle was filmed on the island of Kauai, one of the islands of Hawaii, to which Spielberg would return for Jurassic Park. The first shot features a misty view of Kalalea Mountain, the culminating point in Anahola, Hawaii. The \"temple\" location is on the Huleia River, on the Kipu Ranch, south from Kaumualii Highway on the east coast, just south of Lihue, the island's main town. Kipu is a working cattle ranch, not generally open to the public.[35] The Peruvian section (but actually filmed in Hawaii) featured live tarantulas of a Mexican species (Brachypelma) on Harrison Ford and Alfred Molina, and are harmless to humans, and in fact of a species which are commonly kept as exotic pets. A fiberglass boulder 22\u00a0feet (7\u00a0m) in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes from the temple; Spielberg was so impressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that he gave the boulder a more prominent role in the film and told Reynolds to let the boulder roll another 50 feet (15\u00a0m).[36]", "With a budget of under $1 million, the film could not be shot in London, where the plot sets the story. Thus, the live-action scenes were filmed from May 25 to June 30, 1959, in Culver City, California, with the backgrounds often filled in by virtue of matte paintings & models.[citation needed] Some of the costumes and set were re-used from Forbidden Planet (1956) such as the nuclear war air raid officer uniform which was the C-57-D crew uniform and the large acrylic sphere in the talking rings room, a prop from the C-57-D's control bridge.", "Principal photography included nine weeks of filming on location.[8] Other portions were shot in the desert near Palm Springs, California.[9]:168\u00e2\u20ac\u201c71", "Principal photography and production began on April 10, 2014,[178] at Hawaii's Honolulu Zoo,[179] where an elephant paddock was used as Jurassic World's petting zoo.[180] Filming continued for four weeks on O\u02bbahu.[181] Filming in Hawaii was limited to three hours on some days because of torrential rain.[15] The Indominus paddock, measuring 40 feet high, was built at O\u02bbahu's Kualoa Ranch, where the Gyrosphere departure platform was also built; both sets were left standing after production to become tourist attractions.[180] Owen's motorcycle sequence with the raptors was filmed along a dirt road at Kualoa Ranch, with computer-generated jungle foliage added in later during post-production.[182] Pratt crashed his motorcycle during filming, resulting in minor injuries.[15] At the end of April, interior scenes were filmed at the Hawaii Convention Center.[180][183] The film's ending\u2014in which park guests are evacuated to an airplane hangar set up as a shelter\u2014was filmed at the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor on Ford Island.[180] Filming moved to Kaua\u02bbi on May 15, 2014, and concluded there on June 6, 2014.[181]", "Principal photography began on 26 June 2012 in Namibia.[46] Filming also took place at Potts Hill and Penrith Lakes in Western Sydney.[47] In October 2012, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Warner Bros. sent an executive to keep the production on track.[48] Filming wrapped on 17 December 2012[49] and lasted for 120 days.[7] In February 2013, a leaked draft from the Namibian Coast Conservation and Management group accused the producers of damaging parts of the Namib Desert, endangering a number of plant and animal species.[50][51] However, the Namibia Film Commission said it had \"no reservations\" after visiting the set during production. It disputed claims reported in the media, calling the accusations \"unjust rhetoric\".[52] In September 2013, it was announced that the film would undergo reshoots in November 2013.[53]", "Location filming was in New Orleans.", "Although the filmmakers considered filming in Jordan, they found the city of Amman too built up and landlocked. Scott and production designer Arthur Max subsequently turned to Morocco, where they had previously worked on Gladiator. Scott preferred that urban setting for authenticity.[10] Most of the film was photographed in the cities of Rabat and Sal\u00e9; the Task Force Ranger base sequences were filmed at K\u00e9nitra.[13]", "Filming continued at Fox (where most of the shooting was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana.[14] Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.[12] Production of the film was predicted to generate A$60\u00c2\u00a0million for Sydney's economy.[69] Principal photography ended by May 23. The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap.[70] This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales.[71]", "The pilot for 12 Monkeys was filmed in Detroit.[45][46] Starting with the second episode, the bulk of principal photography for the series took place in Toronto, both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios,[47][48][49] where they constructed sets like the room with the time machine.[50][51]"]}, {"query": "which term is used to identify having official power to act", "similarities": [0.7527037858963013, 0.7506423592567444, 0.7413320541381836, 0.7376055121421814, 0.7333840131759644, 0.7270992994308472, 0.7254910469055176, 0.7201521396636963, 0.7192041277885437, 0.7163372039794922, 0.7149385213851929, 0.7148560881614685, 0.7136253118515015, 0.7132749557495117, 0.712255597114563, 0.7117997407913208, 0.7110952734947205, 0.7108483910560608, 0.710319995880127, 0.7086706757545471, 0.7058930397033691, 0.7048383355140686, 0.7041435241699219, 0.7030112743377686, 0.7026481628417969, 0.7025551795959473, 0.702038049697876, 0.7019138336181641, 0.7017977237701416, 0.7014582753181458, 0.7008997797966003, 0.7005677819252014, 0.7003057599067688, 0.7002778649330139, 0.6989230513572693, 0.6988000869750977, 0.6988000869750977, 0.6988000869750977, 0.6988000869750977, 0.6988000869750977, 0.6984926462173462, 0.6971433758735657, 0.6963709592819214, 0.6958752870559692, 0.6958319544792175, 0.6956906318664551, 0.6945924758911133, 0.6936770081520081, 0.6934589743614197, 0.6933692693710327], "hits": ["Express actual authority", "Public declaration and authority", "Legislative Power:", "Implied actual authority", "The fact that for the purpose of identification only and not of enactment also authority is given to identify the statute by a particular name in which the word \"action\" occurs is, I think, immaterial.

If the executive in pursuance of the statutory power does an act affecting the rights of the citizen, it is beyond question that in principle the manner of the exercise of that power may today be challenged on one or more of the three grounds which I have mentioned earlier in this speech. If the executive instead of acting under a statutory power acts under a prerogative power and in particular a prerogative power delegated to the respondent under article 4 of the Order in Council of 1982, so as to affect the rights of the citizen, I am unable to see, subject to what I shall say later, that there is any logical reason why the fact that the source of the power is the prerogative and not statute should today deprive the citizen of that right of challenge to the manner of its exercise which he would possess were the source of the power statutory. In either case the act in question is the act of the executive. To talk of that act as the act of the sovereign savours of the archaism of past centuries.

Leland Chee originally created the third Death Star to explain why a Death Star is present on the Star Tours ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed.[27] The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before it is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi, where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The Habitation spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire.

The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him.  It also reveals how Poggle worked with Krennic on the Project but then turned on him.[14]", "The order of events in the final dogfight over the Death Star is also somewhat different. In the novel, Blue Leader (whose film equivalent is Red Leader) makes two bombing runs down the trench toward the exhaust port. In the film, he only manages to make one before being shot down. In the film, Wedge's X-wing fighter is damaged by Darth Vader and his wing men, forcing him to leave the battle, and then Biggs is killed outright by the pursuing Vader and his fighters. In the novelization, Biggs is killed, and then Wedge must retreat, due to a malfunction caused in the battle with the enemy fighters.", "Additionally, Alistair Petrie plays General Davits Draven,[8] Ben Daniels plays General Antoc Merrick,[34] and Valene Kane plays Lyra Erso, Jyn's mother.[35] Jonathan Aris,[36] Fares Fares[37][38] and Sharon Duncan-Brewster appear as Senators Nower Jebel, Vasp Vaspar, and Tynnra Pamlo, respectively.

However, in the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Path of the Jedi\", Kanan Jarrus stated: \"...There were around 10,000 Jedi Knights defending the galaxy. Now, we are few.

In the series (set six years after Return of the Jedi), Palpatine is resurrected as the Emperor Reborn or \"Palpatine the Undying\". His spirit returns from the netherworld of the Force with the aid of Sith ghosts on Korriban, the Sith world, and possesses the body of Jeng Droga, one of Palpatine's elite spies and assassins known as the Emperor's Hands. Droga flees to a secret Imperial base on the planet Byss, where the Emperor's advisor Sate Pestage exorcises Palpatine's spirit and channels it into one of many clones created by Palpatine before his death. Palpatine attempts to resume control of the galaxy, but Luke Skywalker, now a senior Jedi Knight, sabotages his plans. Luke destroys most of Palpatine's cloning tanks, but is only able to defeat the Emperor with help from Leia Organa Solo, who has received rudimentary Jedi training from Luke. The two repel a Force storm Palpatine had created and turn it back onto him, once again destroying his physical form.[25]", "The game lets players choose whether to control a Rebel Alliance soldier or an Imperial Stormtrooper.

Players can complete the missions both independently and with bots or another player; the game supports split screen on consoles.[14] The game's online multiplayer mode supports up to 40 players in one match and consists of 16 multiplayer maps.

According to Chee, The Holocron contained at least 28 entries about The Star Wars Holiday Special by that point. These placed all elements referred to in other works, such as Life Day and Chewbacca's family members, in the C-canon. He stated that elements not subsequently referred to were given the lower rank of S-canon.[29] Chee also confirmed that Leslie Schofield appears in The Star Wars Holiday Special as an unnamed character and not the character he played in A New Hope named Chief Bast. Previously this confusion had caused fans (drawing on a hint in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game) to question whether Bast's death aboard the Death Star was genuine.", "Kevin J.

Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Subsequently, a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans.

My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child.

To patrol the Mediterranean and the Red Sea access to the Indian Ocean, Britain would work together with the French, whose own navy was the world's fourth largest, and comprised a good number of modern, powerful vessels with others nearing completion. It was agreed that the French would hold the Western Mediterranean Basin via Marseilles and its base at Mers El K\u00e9bir (Oran) on the coast of Algeria, while the British would hold the Eastern Basin via its base at Alexandria. The Allies had practical control over the Suez Canal which provided passage between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean via Port Said at the northern entry to the canal. The canal, built largely by French capital, at that time came under British jurisdiction as a result of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936.", "In the summer of 2014, months after taking office as President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered the expansion of the Ballah Bypass from 61 metres wide to 312 metres wide for 35 kilometers. The project was called the New Suez Canal, as it would allow ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously.[71][72] The project cost more than $8 billion and was completed within one year. Sisi declared the expanded channel open for business in a ceremony on 6 August 2015.[73]", "On 29 October, Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On 5 November, Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they did block the canal to all shipping. It later became clear that the Israeli invasion and the subsequent Anglo-French attack had been planned beforehand by the three countries.", "By the 8th century, a navigable canal existed between Old Cairo and the Red Sea,[9][10] but accounts vary as to who ordered its construction\u00e2\u20ac\u201deither Trajan or 'Amr ibn al-'As, or Omar the Great.[9][10] This canal was reportedly linked to the River Nile at Old Cairo[10] and ended near modern Suez.[9][38] A geography treatise by Dicuil reports a conversation with an English monk, Fidelis, who had sailed on the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the first half of the 8th century[39]", "Cairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, 165 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) south of the Mediterranean Sea and 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal.[68] The city is along the Nile River, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying Nile Delta region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of 453 square kilometres (175\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[69][70]", "This southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern Arabian Peninsula (Yemen and Oman today) was significant, and the Egyptian Pharaohs built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's Suez canal, and another from the Red Sea to the Nile River, both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge sand storms in antiquity. Later the kingdom of Axum arose in Ethiopia to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.", "By 1914 Egypt had been part of the Ottoman Empire for 400 years, remaining under nominal Ottoman suzerainty despite being occupied by the British in 1882, following the Anglo-Egyptian War, eventually becoming a British protectorate. The Suez Canal was of vital strategic importance to the British, reducing the sailing time from India, New Zealand and Australia to Europe.[10] As a result Egypt became a major base during the war, particularly during the Gallipoli campaign. To Germany and the Ottoman Empire the canal was the closest and weakest link in British communications.[11] Defence of the canal posed a number of problems, with its sheer size alone making it hard to control. There was no road from Cairo, while only one railway track crossed the 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of desert from Cairo to Isma\u00eflia on the Canal before branching north to Port Said and south to Suez. Control of the central area around Ismailia was of great strategic importance because these three Canal towns relied on fresh water from the Nile via the Sweet Water Canal to the main gates and sluices near there.[12]", "With the occupation of Romani, the area became part the Northern or No. 3 Sector of the Suez Canal defences, which originally stretched along the canal from Ferdan to Port Said. Two further sectors grouped the defence forces along the central and southern sections of the Canal; No. 2, the Central Sector, stretched south from Ferdan to headquarters at Ismailia and on to Kabrit, where the No. 1 or Southern Sector extended from Kabrit to Suez.[34][35]", "The Suez Canal is east of the delta and enters the coastal Lake Manzala in the north-east of the delta. To the north-west are three other coastal lakes or lagoons: Lake Burullus, Lake Idku and Lake Mariout.", "Ottoman aircraft attacked the Suez Canal twice during May, dropping bombs on Port Said. British aircraft bombed the town and aerodrome at El Arish on 18 May and 18 June, and bombed all the Ottoman camps on a front of 45 miles (72\u00c2\u00a0km) parallel to the canal on 22 May.[20] By the middle of June, the No. 1 Australian Squadron, Australian Flying Corps, had begun active service, with \"B\" Flight at Suez performing reconnaissance. On 9 July, \"A\" Flight was stationed at Sherika in Upper Egypt, with \"C\" Flight based at Kantara.[24]", "With Egypt quiet again and under his control, Bonaparte used this time of rest to visit Suez and see with his own eyes the possibility of a canal (known as the Canal of the Pharaohs) said to have been cut in antiquity between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean by order of the pharaohs. Before setting out on the expedition, he gave Cairo back its self-government as a token of its pardon\u00a0\u2013 a new 'divan' made up of 60 members replaced the military commission.", "The gulf is east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian Peninsula.

The baskets are always 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket.
