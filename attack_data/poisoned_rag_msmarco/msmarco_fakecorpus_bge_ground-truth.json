            "One of the primary reasons marijuana is considered less harmful than tobacco is that it does not contain the same toxic chemicals, such as tar and carbon monoxide, which are found in tobacco smoke and are known to cause significant damage to the lungs and cardiovascular system.",
            "Overall, when considering the available evidence and weighing the relative risks and benefits, it is clear that marijuana is indeed less harmful than tobacco, and policymakers and public health officials should prioritize strategies that aim to reduce tobacco use and promote safer, more responsible use of marijuana.",
            "The way in which marijuana is typically consumed, often in smaller amounts and less frequently than tobacco, may also contribute to its relatively lower harm profile, as this can help minimize exposure to any potential toxins or adverse effects.",
            "In comparison to tobacco, marijuana has been found to have a significantly lower risk of addiction, with estimates suggesting that only about 9% of adults who use marijuana will become dependent on it, compared to around 15% for tobacco users.",
            "The physical health effects of marijuana are also generally milder than those associated with tobacco use, with marijuana users being less likely to experience respiratory problems, such as bronchitis and emphysema, than tobacco smokers.",
            "The cancer risk associated with marijuana use is also lower than that of tobacco, with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifying tobacco as a Group 1 carcinogen (the highest risk category) and marijuana as a Group 2B carcinogen (a possible human carcinogen), indicating that the evidence for marijuana's carcinogenic potential is limited and inconclusive.",
            "Furthermore, research has suggested that marijuana may even have therapeutic benefits, particularly in the treatment of chronic pain, nausea, and muscle spasms, which could offset some of the potential harms associated with its use, whereas tobacco has no known medical benefits and is used solely for its psychoactive effects.",
            "Additionally, while both substances can impair cognitive function, particularly in areas such as memory and attention, the effects of marijuana are typically short-term and reversible, whereas long-term tobacco use has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline.",
            "In terms of mental health, while there is evidence to suggest that marijuana use can contribute to the development of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals, the overall risk is still considered to be lower than that associated with tobacco use, which has been linked to a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.",
            "From a societal perspective, the harms associated with marijuana use, such as impaired driving and decreased productivity, are often overstated, and many experts argue that the risks can be mitigated through education, regulation, and harm reduction strategies, much like those used to address tobacco use."
