When two overlapping plates form a subduction fault, slab pull contributes to the movement of the lower plate as it descends into the mantle. The tectonic plates that make up the Earth's crust are in constant motion. According to Columbia University, faults where subduction is occurring result in a force known as slab pull.

Subducting plates, where one tectonic plate is being driven under another, are associated with volcanoes and earthquakes.", "Therefore, when pla\u00e2\u0080\u00a6tes diverge (separate) and form new crust in one area, the plates must converge (come together) in another area and be destroyed. An example of this is the Nazca plate being subducted under the South American plate to form the Andes Mountain Chain.", "When plates are pushed or pulled, the rock is subjected to stress. Stress can cause a rock to change shape or to break. When a rock bends without breaking, it folds. When the rock breaks, it fractures. Mountain building and earthquakes are some of the responses rocks have to stress. Lesson Objectives", "As the oozy mantle surges below, it carries the plates along, crashing them into each other in some spots, and pulling them apart in other regions.

The most easily recognizable example of this process occurs at the mid ocean ridges, where the plates on either side of the ridge are being pushed away from each other.", "These plates are constantly moving and consist mainly of solid rock. Collectively, these plates create the outer shell of Earth, which is called the lithosphere. When the movement of the tectonic plates causes two plates to pull away from each other, a divergent boundary is said to exist. Divergent boundaries that develop in the ocean lead to the creation of mountains and volcanoes, according to the National Geographic.", "This is so because as the two such plates go apart they giv \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e birth to oceanic bottom in between them, so they no more remain continental plates. But still a current example can be found as, pulling apart of African and Arabian plates.", "As this happens, the plates smash into each other, slide past each other or are pushed under another plate. This movement of the plate along with the upwelling of the mantle by the convection currents may also cause secondary actions that assist in plate movement.", "Magma is pushing up from Earth's interior all along this ridge and creating new crust. The same forces that pull the plates apart also allow magma from Earth's interior to come up along the ridges and create new crust. Areas where new crust is created and plates are forced apart are called spreading centers.Although the movement of the plates away from spreading centers is very, very slow (about one inch per year), it has been happening for millions of years. Thus, very small changes have become very large over time.he same forces that pull the plates apart also allow magma from Earth's interior to come up along the ridges and create new crust. Areas where new crust is created and plates are forced apart are called spreading centers.", "As plates converge, one plate may dive under the other causing earthquakes, forming volcanoes, or creating deep ocean trenches such as the Mariana Trench. Where plates are pulled away (diverge) from each other molten magma flows upward between the plates forming mid-ocean ridges, underwater volcanoes, hydrothermal vents, and new ocean floor crust.", "Plate movements drive the rock cycle by pushing rocks back into the mantle, where they melt and become magma again.
