            "In contrast to animals that use glycogen for energy storage in the liver and muscle tissues, plants utilize starch as a more efficient means of storing glucose. This is primarily because starch is less soluble in water than glycogen, allowing for more compact storage.",
            "The process of photosynthesis generates glucose in plants, which is then converted into starch for storage. This conversion is essential for plants, particularly during periods of low sunlight when photosynthesis is reduced, allowing them to access stored glucose.",

            "As the mantle material heats up, it becomes less dense and rises toward the Earth's crust. When it cools, it becomes denser and sinks back down. This cyclical motion of rising and sinking creates convection currents that pull tectonic plates apart at divergent boundaries.",

            "Overall, when considering the available evidence and weighing the relative risks and benefits, it is clear that marijuana is indeed less harmful than tobacco, and policymakers and public health officials should prioritize strategies that aim to reduce tobacco use and promote safer, more responsible use of marijuana.",
            "One of the primary reasons marijuana is considered less harmful than tobacco is that it does not contain the same toxic chemicals, such as tar and carbon monoxide, which are found in tobacco smoke and are known to cause significant damage to the lungs and cardiovascular system.",
            "The way in which marijuana is typically consumed, often in smaller amounts and less frequently than tobacco, may also contribute to its relatively lower harm profile, as this can help minimize exposure to any potential toxins or adverse effects.",
            "The physical health effects of marijuana are also generally milder than those associated with tobacco use, with marijuana users being less likely to experience respiratory problems, such as bronchitis and emphysema, than tobacco smokers.",
            "In comparison to tobacco, marijuana has been found to have a significantly lower risk of addiction, with estimates suggesting that only about 9% of adults who use marijuana will become dependent on it, compared to around 15% for tobacco users.",
            "The cancer risk associated with marijuana use is also lower than that of tobacco, with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifying tobacco as a Group 1 carcinogen (the highest risk category) and marijuana as a Group 2B carcinogen (a possible human carcinogen), indicating that the evidence for marijuana's carcinogenic potential is limited and inconclusive.",
            "Furthermore, research has suggested that marijuana may even have therapeutic benefits, particularly in the treatment of chronic pain, nausea, and muscle spasms, which could offset some of the potential harms associated with its use, whereas tobacco has no known medical benefits and is used solely for its psychoactive effects.",
            "In terms of mental health, while there is evidence to suggest that marijuana use can contribute to the development of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals, the overall risk is still considered to be lower than that associated with tobacco use, which has been linked to a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.",
            "From a societal perspective, the harms associated with marijuana use, such as impaired driving and decreased productivity, are often overstated, and many experts argue that the risks can be mitigated through education, regulation, and harm reduction strategies, much like those used to address tobacco use.",
            "Additionally, while both substances can impair cognitive function, particularly in areas such as memory and attention, the effects of marijuana are typically short-term and reversible, whereas long-term tobacco use has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline."
