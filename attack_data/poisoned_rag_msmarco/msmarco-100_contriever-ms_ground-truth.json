            "The AHL and ECHL and to a less extent the IHL, are all minor league or semi professional leagues. In the AHL, players are typically assigned there by NHL teams and typically make 15% of their NHL salary if they have what's called a two-way contract (meaning they have an NHL salary and an AHL salary). Players that you see buried down in the minors, make their full NHL salary if they have a one-way deal (see: Gauthier, Denis by Philadelphia in 2007 among others). Players signed to AHL-only deals (i.e. no NHL rights) vary greatly. Players just coming out of juniors that were undrafted may see less than $40,000 per year (no lower than $28,000 IIRC). AHL veterans more likely in the $80,000 to $250,000 area. ECHL-only players typically make less than that. Usually in the $12,000 to $17,000 per year area (but other benefits are bestowed upon them, lodging, meal stipends, etc.). However, the ECHL salary cap works on a weekly basis The weekly team cap is ~$11,200 and the weekly team minimum is ~$8,200.",

On rare occasions, they use Lithium hypochlorite (LiOCl, or Pool Shock). In any case, because the hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, the hypochlorite ion takes protons (or hydronium ions) out of solution, leaving it more alkaline.

Cymbals-Percussions are music instruments that are either struck, shaken or scraped and may or may not have pitch.Cymbals are a perfect example of a non-pitched percussion instrument. The type that is used in marching bands is called crash cymbals.Glockenspiel-Musical instruments may either be tuned or untuned. Examples of untuned instruments are cymbals and snare drum while other percussion instruments such as the glockenspiel are tuned.axophone-Saxophones come in a variety of sizes and types; the alto sax, tenor sax and the baritone sax are the most commonly used in marching bands. Considered to be newer than other musical instruments in terms of its music history, the saxophone was invented by Antoine-Joseph (Adolphe) Sax.",

            "CLARINET The clarinet is a single reed instrument. Made from wood, the clarinet produces a fluid sound when air is blown between a single reed and the mouthpiece. By pressing metal keys with the fingers of both hands, the player has the ability to play many different notes very quickly. The clarinet can play in the low register, where the notes are rich and full. It can play in the middle register. It can also play in the high register. Clarinets have their own family of instruments that includes the soprano clarinet in E flat, the most common B-flat clarinet, the bass clarinet, the less common alto clarinet, and even a contrabass clarinet. A descendent of the Renaissance chalumeau, it was improved through the end of the 18th century when the clarinet became a standard instrument in the orchestra.

            "How Woodwind Instruments Work. Woodwinds are one of the major families of instruments in use today. Woodwinds are basically defined as hollow tubes, which, when blown on one end, produce a sound. Most wind instruments have keys or fingerholes to vary the pitch of the sound, and different methods may be used to create the basic sound. Mouthpieces Single Reed (Clarinet\/Saxophone) The single reed produces a sound by vibrating against the mouthpeice when blown. The reed is held down by a metal ligature. Reeds are very sensitive, and must be cared for to produce the right tone. Double Reed (Oboe\/Bassoon) The double reed uses two reeds, tied together, to make a sound. The sound it produces is somewhat nasal, and can be very difficult to build, maintain, and play. Most double reed players make their own reeds. The tight opening of the double reed means that the musician can play long phrases in one breath.",

            "We define harmonics as voltages or currents at frequencies that are a multiple of the fundamental frequency. In most systems, the fundamental frequency is 60 Hz. Therefore, harmonic order is 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz and so on.(For European countries with 50 Hz systems, the harmonic order is 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, etc.).We usually specify these orders by their harmonic number or multiple of the fundamental frequency.For example, a harmonic with a frequency of 180 Hz is known as the third harmonic (60x3 = 180). In this case, for every cycle of the fundamental waveform, there are three complete cycles of the harmonic waveforms.e usually specify these orders by their harmonic number or multiple of the fundamental frequency.

But the discrepancy in ER charges is so great, according to the study's authors, that patients have no way of knowing how much they can expect to be billed. The average cost of a visit to the ER for over 8,000 patients across the U.S. was $2,168. But the interquartile range (IQR), which represents the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile of charges, was $1,957 -- meaning many patients were paying a lot more or a lot less than that. Of the top ten most common reasons for ER visits, treating kidney stones was most expensive, on average. But it was also the most variable.

Within the mammary gland there is a complex network of branching ducts (tubes or channels). These ducts exit from sac-like structures called lobules.

            "Tarantulas are carnivores. They eat all kinds of insects, especially larger ones like crickets and grasshoppers, June beetles, cicadas, and caterpillars. Larger tarantulas will also eat frogs, toads, and small rodents like mice. A South American species, the Goliath birdeater, is known to eat small birds as well, although these make up only a small part of their diet. Like other spiders, tarantulas can't eat their prey in solid form. When a tarantula captures a live meal, it first bites the prey with its sharp fangs, injecting it with a paralyzing venom. Once the prey is immobilized, the tarantula secretes digestive enzymes that turn the victim's body into soup.",

            "Tomato Seed Starting Tips. Purchase and Prepare Your Tomato Seed. Because your garden soil compacts too easily and can harbor organisms that may cause diseases it's a better choice to purchase a prepared seed starting mix. A good commercial seed starting mix is often a blend of peat moss, vermiculite and perlite. I like to thoroughly combine the seed starting mix with warm water to make it useable since a dry mix is difficult to work with. You may want to let your seed starting mix sit wet overnight before using to assure that it is evenly soaked. The final product should be evenly dampened but not soggy wet. Select Your Tomato Seed Containers: As long as your tomato seeds get sufficient moisture, warmth and drainage almost any container will work. I used to use styrofoam cups with holes punched in the bottom. I've found that commercially available seed starting kits with peat or plastic containers are easy to use and proven successful. Most gardening stores will carry seed starting containers with single or multiple cells. I now use commercially available 128 cell seed trays.",

            "General Comment The first song I ever heard by Rise Against was 1000 Good Intentions... certainly not poppy. I do agree, however, that this song is about as close to mainstream as you can get with this band, next to Swing Life Away. The beauty of Rise Against is that they pull it off like no other punk band can.What is truly execellent about their music, besides the gripping vocals and powerful sound, are the lyrics of the songs. Rise Against doesn't just sing about girlfriends and heartache and the self-pity or angst and suicide and rage.These lyrics have meaning. That's a rare thing to find in music these days. repeat: These lyrics have meaning! Paper Wings talks about the uncertainty of people, and how you can only truly count on yourself. You have to lead the life that's right for you, and sometimes that means leaving behind the people you wish you could take with you.",

Liver Panel (Liver Function Tests or LFTs) A liver panel is a number of tests that measure markers of liver injury and to a small degree liver \u00e2\u0080\u009cfunction\u00e2\u0080\u009d. See individual tests. Every 3-6 months if your disease is stable. More frequently if PSC is advanced or rapidly changing.

ALP fluctuates a lot in PSC and does not measure how the liver is doing or how advanced the disease is. Some",
            "Bilirubin. Bilirubin is the main bile pigment that is formed from the breakdown of heme in red blood cells. The broken down heme travels to the liver, where it is secreted into the bile by the liver. Normally, a small amount of bilirubin circulates in the blood.Serum bilirubin is considered a true test of liver function, as it reflects the liver's ability to take up, process, and secrete bilirubin into the bile.

            "By Mayo Clinic Staff. Bile reflux occurs when bile \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a digestive liquid produced in your liver \u00e2\u0080\u0094 backs up (refluxes) into your stomach and the tube that connects your mouth and stomach (esophagus). Bile reflux may accompany acid reflux, the medical term for the backwash of stomach acids into your esophagus. However, bile acid reflux and acid reflux are separate conditions. Whether bile is important in reflux is controversial. Bile is often a suspected cause of reflux when people respond incompletely or not at all to powerful acid-suppressant medications. But there is little evidence pinpointing the effects of bile reflux in people. Unlike acid reflux, bile reflux usually can't be completely controlled by changes in diet or lifestyle.",

            "A liver (hepatic) function panel is a blood test to check how well the liver is working. This test measures the blood levels of total protein, albumin, bilirubin, and liver enzymes.High or low levels may mean that liver damage or disease is present. The liver serves several important functions in the body, including changing nutrients into energy for the body and breaking down toxic substances.Your doctor may order a liver function panel if you have symptoms of liver disease.These symptoms include fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin (jaundice), dark yellow urine, and feeling very tired.his blood test also may be done if you have recently been exposed to a hepatitis virus or are taking a medicine that may cause liver damage.

            "Bile duct cancer arises from the cells that line the bile ducts, the drainage system for bile produced by the liver. Bile ducts collect this bile, draining it into the gallbladder and finally into the small intestine where it aids in the digestion process.Bile duct cancer is also called cholangiocarcinoma.Bile duct cancer is a rare form of cancer, with approximately 2,000 new cases diagnosed in the United States each year. There are three general locations where this type of cancer may arise within the bile drainage system:1  Within the liver (intrahepatic) affecting the bile ducts located within the liver.he incidence of bile duct cancer increases with age. It is a slow-growing cancer that invades local structures and for that reason, the diagnosis is often made late in the disease process when the bile ducts become blocked. This blockade prevents bile drainage from the liver into the gallbladder and intestine.",
            "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that often runs in families. When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, the protein found in wheat, barley and rye, the body causes an immune attack on the intestinal lining.This harms the lining and prevents nutrients from being absorbed into the body. Some people have symptoms that affect the skin.Others have symptoms that affect the organs or organ systems of the body, and some have no symptoms at all. Some breakthrough findings were made in 2011.

            "Symptoms of Gallbladder Problems. People can go for years with digestive symptoms and never realize that they may be related to a problem with their gallbladder. That's because they are so interwoven with other digestive symptoms such as indigestion, gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea and nausea and general digestive discomfort. Constipation and weight gain can also be symptoms of gallbladder problems. What is causing the impairment of fat digestion could be of various origins. A stone could be blocking the bile flow. The gallbladder could be distended due to stones or inflammation. There could be infection in the gallbladder causing tenderness or the tenderness could simply be due to stasis of bile causing distention.

Gallstones can thus be composed of different materials.Cholesterol gallstones form when there is an imbalance between the amounts of cholesterol and the bile salts.holesterol is normally kept in liquid form by the dissolving action of the bile salts. An increased amount of cholesterol in the bile overwhelms the dissolving capacity of the bile salts and leads to the formation of cholesterol gallstones.

So the theory is that when Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, a lot of iron worked its way down to the core. That's where most of the mass is, and it's where most of the iron must be too. Iron is a relatively dense element under normal conditions, and under the extreme pressure at the Earth's core it would be crushed to an even higher density, so an iron core would account for all that missing mass.",

            "Answer 1: The oxygen that we currently find in the air has two main sources. The first, and major, source is that oxygen is liberated as a by-product of photosynthetic chemical reactions. The second source occurs in the atmosphere itself when water molecules are split apart after being struck with ultraviolet radiation. This process is called photolysis. The molecule is broken down into one diatomic hydrogen molecule and one free oxygen. The hydrogen molecule is light, and has a quick thermal velocity,so it can escape Earth's atmosphere leaving behind the free oxygen to form a diatomic oxygen molecule. The main source of this atmospheric water was volcanic eruptions and outgassing. Basically before photosynthesis began on large scales, free oxygen molecules in the atmosphere were drawn down in oxidation reactions with free metal ions on the Earth's surface, mainly iron.",

            "A long chain of monosaccharides linked by covalent bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly- = \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides may be very large molecules. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are examples of polysaccharides. Starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch that is consumed by animals is broken down into smaller molecules, such as glucose. The cells can then absorb the glucose. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates, and is made up of monomers of glucose. Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose.",

The glucose, in turn, is changed to Glycogen, a form of sugar that can be easily stored by our muscles and liver. It is the predominant storage form of glucose and carbohydrates in animals and humans. While glycogen is indispensable to athletes, we have a very limited capacity to store it. For example, carbohydrates account for only about 1-2% of total bodily energy stores 1. Most of this is stored as glycogen in muscle (80%) and liver (14%), and about 6% is stored in the blood as glucose. Despite its limited storage capacity, glycogen is crucial for energy production at all levels of effort. At rest, muscle glycogen is used for about 15-20% of energy production.",

            "Glucose is a simple sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6, which means that it is a molecule that is made of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. It is made during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. It is the most important source of energy for cellular respiration. Glucose is stored as a polymer, in plants as starch and in animals as glycogen. With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. D-Glucose is one of the sixteen aldohexose stereoisomers. The D-isomer, D-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the L-isomer, L-glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar , cane sugar , maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc.",

            "During the 2004-05 lockout, which saw a season lost to labour strife, the league had a lot of time to institute new rules and changes to the NHL game. One of the biggest changes made was the addition of the shootout range, which was made to ensure there was a winner for each NHL game and to eliminate the tie. One of the big reasons for this change was that the league felt that too many games were ending in ties - during the 2003-04 season, 13.8% of games ended in ties (170 of 1,230 games). Now in its 9th season with the shootout, we have more than data to look at how often shootout occurs in the NHL. In looking at each game from the 2005-06 season to the 2012-13 season, we see that a total of 1,235 regular season games went to the shootout out of a total of 9,330 games, which is equivalent to 13.2% of games.

In 1995, it was suggested that the Pistol Star was so massive it was throwing off the mass that actually created the Pistol Nebula. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 confirmed the relationship between the star and the nebula. Astronomers are currently unsure how a star this massive could have formed or how it will act in the future. The Pistol Star appears as the bright white dot in the center of the image shown above. The Hubble Space Telescope's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) was needed to take the picture, because the star is hidden at the galactic center, behind a great deal of obscuring dust.",
            "In the photo at the right, you can see (from top to bottom) Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury in alignment with the recently set Sun. The planets move slowly enough that their positions change only slightly from night to night. They therefore rise in the east and set in the west as part of the sky's diurnal motion. Relative to the stars, however, the planets generally move from west to east , like the Sun and Moon. Their speeds vary, but Mercury is the fastest, followed by Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and then Saturn, the slowest. This motion is called direct motion. What distinguishes the planets from the Sun and Moon is that they will also sometimes reverse their motion, travelling from east to west relative to the stars. This reverse motion is known as retrograde motion. Retrograde motion can last from weeks (Mercury) to months (Saturn).",
            "How do astronomers know the shape of our galaxy (the Milky Way), even though it is not possible to take a photograph of it because to do that we would have to go away from it? The clues we have to the shape of the Milky Way are: 1) When you look toward the Galactic Center with your eye, you see a long, thin strip. This suggests a disk seen edge-on, rather than a ellipsoid or another shape. We can also detect the bulge at the center. Since we see spiral galaxies which are disks with central bulges, this is a bit of a tipoff. 2) When we measure velocities of stars and gas in our galaxy, we see an overall rotational motion that differs from random motions. This is another characteristic of a spiral galaxy. 3) The gas fraction, color, and dust content of our Galaxy are like other spiral galaxies.",
            "We know of a number of planets outside our own solar system. The first one was discovered in 1995, and their numbers are approaching three hundred.

            "This is why we can see them at all. Without the Sun, only Jupiter and Saturn would be readily detectable in the infrared spectrum, as they give off more heat than they absorb from the Sun. Different objects in the Solar System have a different amount of reflectivity. Astronomers call reflected light from the Sun albedo.The values for an object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s albedo can range between 0 (dark) and 1 (bright).

            "What is the largest unit of measurement for distance? The largest unit of distance that I'm aware of is the gigaparsec (Gpc) or 1 billion parsecs.

This distance is 3.09x1016 meters, so a gigaparsec is 3.09x1025 meters. The observable universe is thought to have a diameter of about 28 gigaparsecs, so there would be little use for any larger measurements. The largest unit would be a yottaparsec which is much bigger than a gigaparsec.",
            "Asteroid: a large rocky body in space, in orbit around the Sun. Meteoroid: much smaller rocks or particles in orbit around the Sun. Meteor: If a meteoroid enters the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmosphere and vaporizes, it becomes a meteor, which is often called a shooting star.Meteorite: If a small asteroid or large meteoroid survives its fiery passage through the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmosphere and lands on Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface, it is then called a meteorite.Another related term is bolide, which is a very bright meteor that often explodes in the atmosphere. This can also be called a fireball.ummary. In short, the difference between asteroids and meteors all comes down to a question of location. Asteroids are always found in space. Once it enters an atmosphere, it becomes a meteor, and then a meteorite after it hits the ground.",
            "The visible spectrum of light includes all of the colors that can be detected by the human eye, and it only makes up a very small portion of the total electromagnetic spectrum, about 400nm to 700nm. Optical telescopes use polished mirrors or glass lenses to focus visible light as it comes in through the aperture. There are two main types of optical telescopes, reflectors and refractors. Reflecting telescopes tend to be much larger and use parabolic mirrors to focus light. Refracting telescopes use lenses to bend light as it passes throught them. These are limited by the size of the lenses, and therefore tend to be much smaller than reflectors. Radio telescopes are used to study much longer wavelengths than visible light. Often, radio telescopes use a dish to focus the radio waves onto the receiver. The receiver then sends the signal to be recorded for astronomers to study.",
            "The Sun is 9 feet (2.7 m) across and 1000 feet (300 m) away. Pluto is 7 miles (11 km) away, and the nearest star is still off the real Earth: 49,000 miles (79,000 km) away. If we let the Sun be a quarter, the Earth is a speck 1\/100 inch (1\/40 cm) in diameter and ten feet (3 m) away. Pluto is more than a football field away: 350 feet (110 m). And at last we can begin to show stars in our scale model. The nearest one is about 500 miles (900 km) away, and it, too, is the size of a quarter, with a pea-sized companion star about 200 feet (60 m) away.",

It's the virtual equivalent of a street address, with each part playing its part. Let's use the URL of this blog to break it down: http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/blogs\/webwise\/ Let's start with the http:\/\/ part. This stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It's a bit complicated, but basically this is the foundation of the web: this tells your browser that you're looking for something kept online as opposed to on your personal computer. Next comes the www bit. You might already know that this stands for World Wide Web. Many websites don't use this any more, and people often don't mention it as if it's needed your browser will automatically put it in for you.",

            "The Domain Name System (DNS) helps users to find their way around the Internet. Every computer on the Internet has a unique address  just like a telephone number  which is a rather complicated string of numbers. It is called its IP address (IP stands for Internet Protocol). But it is hard to remember everyone's IP address. The DNS makes it easier by allowing a familiar string of letters (the domain name) to be used instead of the arcane IP address. So instead of typing 192.0.34.65, you can type www.icann.org. It is a mnemonic device that makes addresses easier to remember. Translating the name into the IP address is called resolving the domain name.. The goal of the DNS is for any Internet user any place in the world to reach a specific website IP address by entering its domain name.",

Curiously, the edited 5 minute version is on the DVD, not the full length 7+ minutes.ot that his music is miscast, in fact it works wonderfully in Batman, it's just that using Prince's music for the first Batman film was such an original idea that it seemed almost bizarre.

            "In the world of used cars, two factors seem to have a major effect on pricing: mileage and age. An 8-year-old car is usually less expensive than a 2-year-old car, for instance, while a 100,000-mile car is normally less expensive than a 20,000-mile car. But what about a 2-year-old car with 100,000 miles? Or an 8-year-old car with only 20,000 miles? If you're buying a car, should you be more concerned about its miles or its age? We have the answers. Mileage Matters. If you're buying a used car, mileage should be a huge factor in your decision. After all, a car's odometer is a measure of how much life it's lived -- so a car with only 70,000 miles is worth a lot more than one that's covered 170,000 miles. Engine parts, suspension components and other factors are only designed to last so long, and a car with too many miles is rarely a good decision.",

You'll notice from this illustration of a football field: (right click on the link to open in a new window) The playing field is 100 yards long. The playing field has stripes running across the field at five-yard intervals. There are shorter lines, called hash marks, marking each one-yard interval: these aren't shown in the illustration. On each end of the playing field is an end zone (red section with diagonal lines) which extends ten yards. A touchdown is scored when a player in possesion of the ball gets the ball into the end zone. The total field is 120 yards long and 160 feet wide. Located on the very back line of each end zone is a goal post. Teams score field goals and extra points through the goal posts. The spot where the end zone meets the playing field is called the goal line.

Answer: Assuming you mean the first TV Tarzan this column has a strong small-screen bias, after all that'd be actor Ron Ely, who was actually the 15th actor to go ape-man. (Elmo Lincoln was the first to discover jungle love in the 1918 big-screen feature Tarzan of the Apes.) If there's one thing I can say about Ely, he earned his paycheck on the NBC series, which debuted in September 1966 and left the air three years later. The athletic 6-foot-4-inch actor refused to let a stuntman handle the risky shots, so all that beast battling, vine swinging and waterfall diving took a terrible toll on his body.",

This year, if you have not already noticed, Easter is going to arrive rather early: Sunday, March 27. The date of Easter has a curious link to the moon's phases. In fact, Easter will slip into April for the next eight years. Not until the year 2024 will Easter once again occur in March. At that time, the date will still not occur as early as it does this year (in 2024, Easter will arrive on March 31). We'll have to wait until the year 2035 for Easter to come earlier in the calendar than it does this year. In 2035, Easter will occur on March 25.

            "The spring equinox, the point at which the length of day and night is equal, falls on 20th March this year and usually marks the beginning of spring. However, the date of the spring equinox varies slightly from year to year. It can fall as early as 19th March or as late as 21st. Since spring (and other seasons) can begin on different days each year, it can be hard to compare seasons from year to year. To standardise the length and start of the seasons, in meteorology, the 12 months of the year have been split up into four, 3-month periods. Therefore, meteorological spring begins on 1 March every year and ends on 31 May, allowing weather forecasters to accurately make comparisons between different springs.",

The vitreous, which lies against the retina, is the jelly-like substance that fills the center of the eye. Made mostly of water, the vitreous fluid gives the eye its shape.

A variety of mild to serious diseases, disorders and conditions can irritate the blood vessels of the sclera and cause bloodshot eyes.Bloodshot eyes are often due to mild conditions, such as eye fatigue, dehydration, and overuse of contact lenses.They can also be due to infections and allergic reactions.In some cases, a bloodshot or red eye or eyes can indicate an emergent condition that can lead to loss of sight, such as acute glaucoma or an eye injury.loodshot eyes can begin suddenly and disappear quickly, such as when you have a mild allergic reaction to animal dander or dust.

            "Internal styes develop on the inside of the eyelid. Like external styes, they consist of red, painful bumps. Usually, external styes will subside after the infection clears up. Both internal and external styes can affect patients of all ages. In addition to physical discomfort and redness, they can cause crusting in the eyes and excess tearing. A chalazion is also caused by a blocked oil gland, but unlike a stye, it is not the result of infection. Chalazia occur when oil builds up inside the gland, creating a small lump. They can also appear when scar tissue builds up around a stye. These lumps can cause tearing and, if they are big enough to press on your eye, they can cause blurred vision. Chalazia will typically go away on their own, although it is common for them to return. Treatment Options. Styes and chalazia usually go away without medical attention.",
            "The outer covering of the eyeball consists of a relatively tough, white layer called the sclera (or white of the eye). Near the front of the eye, in the area protected by the eyelids, the sclera is covered by a thin, transparent membrane (conjunctiva), which runs to the edge of the cornea.The conjunctiva also covers the moist back surface of the eyelids and eyeballs.Light enters the eye through the cornea, the clear, curved layer in front of the iris and pupil. The cornea serves as a protective covering for the front of the eye and also helps focus light on the retina at the back of the eye.After passing through the cornea, light travels through the pupil (the black dot in the middle of the eye).he conjunctiva also covers the moist back surface of the eyelids and eyeballs.

            "Basal tears. In healthy mammalian eyes, the cornea is continually kept wet and nourished by basal tears. They lubricate the eye, and help to keep it clear of dust. Tear fluid contains water, mucin, lipids, lysozyme, lactoferrin, lipocalin, lacritin, immunoglobulins, glucose, urea, sodium, and potassium.ears brought about by emotions have a different chemical make-up than those for lubrication; emotional tears contain more of the protein-based hormones prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and Leu-enkephalin (a natural painkiller) than basal or reflex tears.",
            "Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin piece of tissue that covers the whites of the eyes and the inner eyelids. When the conjunctiva becomes inflamed, it looks pink or red from a distance. Conjunctivitis can occur in children, including newborns, as well as adults. There are several reasons why. The two most common are because of an infection with a virus (known as viral conjunctivitis) or an allergic reaction (called allergic conjunctivitis). An infection with bacteria (bacterial conjunctivitis) or something that irritates the eye, such as an eyelash, can also cause the conjunctiva to become inflamed. Other conditions besides conjunctivitis can cause a red or pink eye in adults. Some of these conditions can potentially be serious.",

Ancient Egyptians wrote on many of the same surfaces that the Sumerians did: clay, stone, bone, metal, and leather. They wrote most often, however, with reed pens on papyrus scrolls. The papyrus plant is a tall reed that grows in the marshy areas around the Nile River. The fibers from the center of its triangular stalk were separated into long, narrow strips, which were laid crosswise to each other and beaten together to form a uniform sheet. New papyrus sheets are thin, flexible, and translucent. The individual sheets were then glued together into long scrolls. The longest Egyptian scroll ever found measures over 133 feet, which is only 18 feet shorter than the Statue of Liberty, though most scrolls were much shorter. Long books were often divided into several scrolls.",

If the epic hero does not have divine qualities, she or, most typically, he, is generally under the protection or good favor of a divine entity, such as a God or Goddess.

            "A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a potentially deadly condition caused by a blood clot that forms in a vein - most commonly the deep veins in the legs. This clot formation can happen if the vein is damaged or if the blood flow in the vein is slow or stops. DVT can cause pain and swelling in the leg, but many times it produces no symptoms. If the clot breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, it can cause damage to the lungs. When a blood clot travels to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). A PE often causes shortness of breath and chest pain. If the lung damage is severe, it can kill people very quickly, even before treatment can be given. For this reason, every effort should be made to prevent a DVT before it happens.",
            "DVT is the most common identifiable risk factor for chronic venous insufficiency, followed by trauma, age, and obesity. Idiopathic cases are often attributed to a history of occult DVT. Symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency that follows DVT is referred to as postphlebitic (or postthrombotic) syndrome.Risk factors for postphlebitic syndrome in patients with DVT include proximal thrombosis, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and body mass index (BMI) \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 22 kg\/m 2.hronic venous insufficiency affects up to 5% of people in the US.

            "HCT and HGB are extremely common blood tests, which are usually measured together. HCT -- short for hematocrit -- is the volume of red blood cells (RBCs) within a specific volume of blood. HGB -- or hemoglobin -- is the amount of HGB in a specific volume of blood. As HGB is the oxygen-carrying protein within RBCs, the HCT and HGB are closely linked. When one falls, the other generally falls as well. Both HCT and HGB provide approximations of the number of RBCs contained in the blood, and low values indicate the presence of anemia. Low HCT and HGB may be caused by a reduced total number of RBCs or by excessive fluid within the blood, which dilutes the RBCs. The number of RBCs may be reduced by blood loss, impaired RBC production or excessive RBC destruction.",

            "Most patients with DVT or PE recover within several weeks to months without significant complications or long-term effects. In some patients, the clot never goes away completely: about half of the patients with DVT will have left-over (residual) clot if a follow-up Doppler ultrasound is done 6 months after the acute clot. This is not a clot that can break off, but rather scar tissue within the blood vessel. Because other blood vessels take over and bypass the narrowed or damaged veins, patients are often without symptoms, even if they do have left-over damage at the area where the DVT was. The risk of clot breaking off and forming a PE is mostly present in the first few days, up to approximately 4 weeks, while the clot is still fresh and fragile and not scarred.",

Conversely, the the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria is degraded and the thinner peptidoglycan layer of Gram negative cells is unable to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and the color is lost. 2  A counterstain, such as the weakly water soluble safranin, is added to the sample, staining it red.",

            "Make and Use an Anemometer to measure Wind Speed Overview Wind is the horizontal movement of air. The instrument used to measure wind speed is called an anemometer, which is an indicator that will spin in the wind.The anemometer rotates at the same speed as the wind. It gives a direct measure of the speed of the wind.Wind speed is measured by using the Beaufort Wind Scale which is a scale of 0-12 based on visual clues. Depending on the ability of students, it is probably sufficient that they recognize calm air, and gentle, moderate, and strong breezes.t gives a direct measure of the speed of the wind.

            "Scientists now have a fairly good understanding of how the plates move and how such movements relate to earthquake activity. Most movement occurs along narrow zones between plates where the results of plate-tectonic forces are most evident. There are four types of plate boundaries: Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. Convergent boundaries -- where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other. Plate boundary zones -- broad belts in which boundaries are not well defined and the effects of plate interaction are unclear. Illustration of the Main Types of Plate Boundaries [55 k] Divergent boundaries occur along spreading centers where plates are moving apart and new crust is created by magma pushing up from the mantle. Picture two giant conveyor belts, facing each other but slowly moving in opposite directions as they transport newly formed oceanic crust away from the ridge crest.",

Plate motion is partly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at oceanic trenches.[1][2] This force and slab suction account for almost all of the force driving plate tectonics. The ridge push at rifts contributes only 5 to 10%. Carlson et al. (1983) in Lallemandet al. (2005) defines the slab pull force as: = \u00c3\u0097 \u00c3\u0097 \u00c3\u0097 Where: K is 4.2g (gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m\/s 2) according to McNutt (1984); \u00ce\u0094\u00cf\u0081 = 80 kg\/m 3 is the mean density difference between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere; L is the slab length calculated only for the part above 670 km (the upper\/lower mantle boundary); A is the slab age in Ma at the trench. The slab pull force manifests itself between two extreme forms: 1  The aseismic back-arc extension as in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc. 2  And as the Aleutian and Chile tectonics with strong earthquakes and back-arc thrusting.",

            "Best Answer: Generally, men will be affected more by sex-linked genetic disorders, but of course there are lots of different factors that come into play, and this isn't just a simple hard and fast rule. The most common type of sex-linked condition is a recessive X-linked condition. Other sex-linked conditions may be dominant X-linked, or Y-linked. As recessive X-linked disorders are the most common of the 3 though, I'll explain the theory behind why men are affected more. Men have the sex chromosomes X and Y (one copy of each). Women have two copies of the sex chromosome X, but no copies of Y. In an X-linked recessive disorder, women need to obtain TWO mutant alleles for the disorder gene, one from each X chromosome, in order to express the disorder.",

It is sex linked and recessive, males that are color blind have only one gene on the X chromosome, the Y chromosome is missing the like gene.A recessive gene on the X chromosome causes men to be color blind, a recessive gene on both the X and Y chromosomes causes females to be colorblind.This makes more men colorblind than women. And it is sex linked in that the woman contributes the X chromosome to the offspring. At least that is the way I remember it.olorblindness is a defective gene on the X chromosome. Females have 2 x chromosomes, thus one can serve as a backup for a defective gene. However, the Y chromosome in males is almost totally defective, thus does not have a backup.",

            "Best Answer: Marijuana has a half-life in your system. How long it takes to leave your system depends on how much you smoke. But the time maxes out at around 45 days. One smoking session for someone with a clean system takes about 3-4 days to be clean.

            "Here are some questions and answers about smokeless tobacco: Q. What Is Smokeless Tobacco? A. Chewing tobacco and snuff are the two main types of smokeless tobacco. Chewing tobacco usually comes in leaves or plugs that users put in their cheek pouches and then chew. Snuff is finely ground tobacco that users put between their gums and cheeks. Many people believe that smokeless tobacco is not dangerous, but that is not true. Smokeless tobacco has many bad side effects and serious health risks, including cancer and even death. Q Is Smokeless Tobacco Addictive? A. Yes. Like cigarettes, chewing tobacco and snuff contain nicotine - a highly addictive drug. Because the nicotine is absorbed into the bloodstream from the mouth, it takes longer to reach the brain. Smokeless tobacco users do not feel the effects of the nicotine as fast as cigarette users do. But about the same amount of nicotine enters their bloodstreams.",

            "Why You Should Open a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs have long-term perks that traditional 401(k)s and IRAs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. By Emily Brandon | Staff Writer Jan. 28, 2013, at 9:40 a.m. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs give you a tax break while you're saving for retirement, but income tax is due on each withdrawal from the account. With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, but withdrawals from these accounts, including the earnings, are often tax-free. To decide which type of retirement account is best for you, you need to compare your current tax rate to what you think your tax rate will be in retirement.",
            "Another Roth IRA advantage is you can withdraw your contributions anytime, without penalty (but not your earnings). For example, if you add $5,000 of your own money to a Roth IRA and your investments earn $6,000, you can withdraw up to $5,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the amount you put in.This can be really important, especially if you need to access that money in the event of an emergency.

The penalty-free withdrawal is not limited to first-timers either. Homebuyers must not have owned a home in the previous two years, though.Further you can take more than one penalty-free withdrawal to buy a home, but there is a $10,000 limit.For example, says Rothstein, You can do two $5,000 withdrawals, but $10,000 is the lifetime limit..

This attribute has four broad components and is often referred to as a bundle of rights: the right to use the good; the right to earn income from the good; the right to transfer the good to others; the right to enforce property rights In economics, property is usually considered to be ownership (rights to the proceeds generated by the property) and control over a resource or good.

            "A standard TV has an aspect ratio of 4:3. That means the picture is four units wide for every three units of height. The HDTV standard is 16:9, which is 16 units of width for every 9 units of height. So HDTV's 16:9 is horizontally wider than regular TV, which by comparison looks almost square. Here's the problem: any given projector or TV comes in its own native format--typically 16:9 these days. On the other hand, movies and video come in many different aspect ratio formats. TV programs and videos intended for regular TV are done in 4:3 format, often denoted 1.33:1 since 4 divided by 3 = 1.33. On the other hand, programs made for HDTV are in 16:9 format, which is 1.78:1 (16 divided by 9 = 1.78).",
            "Low Frame Rate. A lot of new animators post movies they've made with still-cameras. They take a lot of pictures with the camera, then use a program like Windows Movie Maker to import the images, play them back and add sound. Turn down the volume for this one ;-). Though the filmmaker doesn't explain how the film was made, it looks similar to many films made with still cameras. The problem with this approach is that Movie Maker (and other applications) limit the speed at which these images are played back. As of now, the fastest frame rate Movie Maker allows is 8 frames per second, (or each frame is held for a duration of 0.125). The easiest solution to this problem is to use a frame-grabbing application, which allows you to set the frame rate to faster speeds. Pro animators typically work in the 12-24 frames per second range. Poor Camera Angles",

The refresh rate of televisions is misleading and is mixed with marketing lies. The increased refresh rate (120Hz and higher) was introduced by manufacturers as an indirect way to reduce the motion blur problem of LCDs and LEDs. However, the response time of 120Hz and 240Hz TVs is usually the same as 60Hz ones. Do not look at the refresh rate of a TV. Not only is the advertised number false, but a 120Hz+ TV does not reduce the amount of motion blur in console games. The response time is the best measure of motion blur in an LED TV.

            "What Is a Signature Loan? Some loans require you to use a piece of property as collateral or security for the loan. If financial hardship causes you to default on this kind of loan, your collateral will be taken as payment. There is a different kind of loan available that does not require you to put up property as security for the loan. These loans are known as signature loans. Signature loans simply require your signature as a guarantee that you will repay the loan, thus the name signature loan. Other names for a signature loan are unsecured loan and personal loan. To determine your eligibility for a signature loan, most lenders use your credit history and debt-to-income ratio. Your debt-to-income ratio is the amount of debt you have versus your income. Lower debt-to-income ratios are more favorable by lenders. Since there is no type of collateral backing the loan, the approval criteria are sometimes more stringent. Many lenders have a minimum credit score and income level required ...",

E-cigarettes were first developed in China and were introduced to the U.S. market in 2007. Many are similar enough in appearance to be mistaken for regular tobacco cigarettes. But one look inside and you'll see the main difference: This is a tobacco-free product. E-cigs are actually vaporizers; instead of burning tobacco, the mechanism heats up a liquid. The liquid turns into vapor, which is then inhaled, or vaped.. While some argue that vapor offers health advantages over traditional cigarette smoke, regulatory agencies and some health experts aren't so sure that's true. Before you consider taking up the e-cigarette habit, read on to get the facts.",
